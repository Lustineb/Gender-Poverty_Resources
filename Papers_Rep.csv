Who are Central Banks? Gender, Human Resources, and Central BankingĘ;Central banks, as the epitome of the economics profession and the main paragon of public institutions, can reveal key insights into gender patterns. We create a novel multidimensional survey directed at eight central banks in advanced economies (G7 national central banks and the European Central Bank), covering several aspects of gender, such as womenŐs participation at different seniority levels, employment trends, and human resources practices. These elements are summarized in a new comprehensive index of gender equalityŃHuman Resources Gender Index (HRGI). We show that these central banks have room for improvement in the inclusion of women in economics professions, managerial positions, and with full time contracts. Women in central banking also face a gender pay gap. In comparison, International Financial Institutions (the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank Group, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) perform better in terms of gender equality. The HRGI index, hiring and promotion of women, and their contract types are associated with output and credit gaps, thus being of macro-critical importance. In return, some country characteristics can be related to gender equality, such as women in high-level positions, government effectiveness, and corruption.;Ownership and Use of Economic Assets;Advanced Economies;Working paper;International Monetary Fund;May-23;"Comunale, Mariarosaria ; de Bruxelles, Petra ; Kochhar, Kalpana ; Raskauskas, Juliette ; Unsal, D Filiz";https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2023/English/wpiea2023091-print-pdf.ashx;Female Labor Force Participation (FLFP), Gender Pay Gap, Leadership & Management;

Part III provides more detailed data on each of these three themes across each of the 54 African countries.";Other;Africa;Volume;African Development Bank;Jun-23;ADB;https://www.afdb.org/en/documents/gender-poverty-and-environmental-indicators-african-countries-2023;Climate & Environment;
Gender and Firm Performance in Africa: Does the Business Environment Play a Moderating Role?;This paper examines the moderating role of the business environment in the relationship between the gender of the top manager and firm performance (measured as sales per employee), and whether female-managed firms perform better the higher the proportion of female employees in the firm. The paper uses World Bank Enterprise Survey data of 14,561 firms from 29 African countries collected between 2010 and 2016. The descriptive analysis reveals significant variation in the performance and experience of business environment constraints that disadvantage female-managed firms. Controlling for potential endogeneity and country fixed effects, we show that female-managed firms are associated with lower performance compared to male-managed firms. Electricity outages, informal competition and corruption account for the performance gap between female- and male-managed firms. However, we show that large female-managed firms perform better than large male-managed firms. Overall, the results imply that strengthening AfricaŐs business environment is central to closing the performance gap between male and female managers.;Leadership;Africa;Research paper;African Economic Research Consortium;Sep-23;"Okumu, Ibrahim Mike

WomenŐs Economic Empowerment in the Pacific Region: A Comprehensive Analysis of Existing Research and Data;"The analysis focuses on entrepreneurship and on micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises owned by women. Drawing on over 200 published papers and studies and 11 quantitative datasets, it looks at what fosters and what hinders womenŐs economic empowerment in the Pacific. It considers business ownership, formalization, and expansion; violence against women and girls; and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Do Age and Gender Make a Difference in the Attitude toward Tax Evasion? Evidence from Five Selected Asian Countries;"This study investigates the impact of age and gender on the attitude toward tax evasion with two objectives: The first objective is to find out if there are significant differences in the attitude toward tax evasion among three age groups (up to 29, 30-49, and 50+ years) in five Asian countries (China, Indonesia, Japan, Philippines, and South Korea). The second objective is to find out if there are significant differences in the attitude toward tax evasion between females and males across the three-age groups (up to 29, 30-49, and 50+ years old) in each of these five-Asian countries.Ę

The results of this study revealed significant differences in the attitude toward tax evasion among the three age groups in China and Indonesia. On the contrary, there are no significant differences in the attitude toward tax evasion among three age groups in Japan, Philippines, and South Korea. With respect to gender, there are significant differences in the attitude toward tax evasion between females and males in the Chinese middle-age group, but not in the youngest and oldest age groups. Similar findings are found in the Philippines sample. With respect to the Indonesian sample, there are significant differences in the attitude toward tax evasion between females and males in the youngest age group, but not in the other two age groups. Similar findings are found in the Philippines sample, but in the middle age group only. Finally, there are no significant differences in the attitude toward tax evasion between females and males in the Japanese and South Korean samples.";Other;Asia;Article;International Journal of Accounting, Economics, and Finance Perspectives;Mar-23;Pardisi, Ashiqullah and McGee, Robert W.;http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4378497;Fiscal Policy;
Gender Differences in Preferences for Non-Pecuniary Benefits in the Labor Market: Experimental Evidence from an Online Freelancing Platform;We conduct an experiment on a major international online freelancing labor market platform to study the impact of greater flexibility in choosing work hours within a day on female participation. We post identical job advertisements (for 320 jobs) covering a wide range of tasks (80 distinct tasks) that differ only in flexibility and the wage offered. Comparing the numbers of applicants for these jobs, we find that though both men and women prefer flexibility, the elasticity of response for women is twice that for the men. Flexible jobs receive 24% more female applications and 12% more male applications compared to inflexible jobs. Our findings have important implications for explaining gender differences in labor market outcomes and for firms interested in attracting more women employees.;Access to Jobs;Asia;Working paper;Asia Development Bank;May-23;Banerjee, Rakesh Bharati, Tushar Fakir, Adnan M.

Gender-Inclusive Development through Fintech: Studying Gender-Based Digital Financial Inclusion in a Cross-Economy Setting;"Financial inclusion (FI) for vulnerable populations, such as women, is critical for achieving gender equality, womenŐs empowerment, and thereby inclusive growth. In this regard, the use of digital financial services is of particular significance for women as it allows them easier access to financial products for business and household needs. For implementing policies to reduce the financial exclusion of women, it is necessary to first measure the extent of FI in a society. While there have been several attempts to measure FI for the general population, there is limited literature on gender-based measurement of FI. We fill this important research gap by developing a gender-based FI index (GFII) focusing particularly on digital services and evaluating the performance of economies across the globe (by considering 109 economies based on data availability) in terms of a gender-based FI measure developed by us. This index has been developed using two separate indices, a digital financial service index (DFI) and a conventional financial service uses index (CFI). One contribution of the paper is to relate the Gender Development Index (GDI) and the Gender Inequality Index (GII) of economies, two well-known measures of inclusive development, with the GFII and the DFI for females (DFIF). This exercise shows that while there is a positive correlation between these two sets of indicators, there are a number of economies that are high (or low) in gender development (or inequality),which need 
to improve their digital FI. Interestingly, using the Global Findex database and the Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS) and instrumental variable panel data model, we show that health, education, the labor force participation rate, and political empowerment of women significantly impact the digital financial inclusion of women. We make relevant policy suggestions for improving womenŐs digital financial access and thereby enhancing gender empowerment for faster and more inclusive growth.";Access to and Use of Services, Ownership and Use of Economic Assets;Asia;Working paper;Asia Development Bank;Jun-23;"

Brecha de ingresos laborales por gŽnero en Repśblica Dominicana: un an‡lisis de la evoluci—n en el per’odo 2000 a 2019;En Repśblica Dominicana se puede apreciar que existe una brecha de ingresos laborales entre hombres y mujeres que se concentra en el sector informal, trabajadores por cuenta propia, y en regiones con econom’as menos din‡micas. Esta brecha no puede explicarse por la experiencia, las caracter’sticas personales y familiares, el sector, la actividad econ—mica, las ocupaciones, la regi—n del pa’s o el entorno (urbano o rural).

Gender Contribution to the Innovation-Productivity Relationship in the Wake of COVID-19: Evidence for the Caribbean;This study presents new findings on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on productivity and innovation for Caribbean firms, with particular focus on the effects on firm gender diversity and workforce composition. Research on the impact of women's participation on firm performance and innovation has so far produced mixed results, though there is some evidence to suggest that for Latin America, larger shares of women in the knowledge creation and innovation process may increase innovative behavior and, as a consequence, lead to greater labor productivity. In the current context, female participation in firms becomes an even more pressing issue, given the early indications of the pandemics disproportionately negative burden on women s income and jobs in different regions. We found that the gender composition of the personnel has an interesting direct effect on productivity. At the same time, our results show that the expected reductions in female personnel due to the pandemic, have a negative effect in the shares of female participation which, in turn, have the potential to nullify the mentioned productivity channel. This suggests the existence of a minimum threshold of female participation to profit from diversity. Hence, it seems that policy should focus particularly on protecting female jobs, particularly in the wake of dramatic shocks affecting revenues and/or employment.;Other;Caribbean;Working paper;Inter-American Development Bank;Mar-23;"Tacsir, Ezequiel;  Pereira, Mariano";http://dx.doi.org/10.18235/0004770;Private Sector, External Shocks, Employment Access & Opportunities, Productivity;
Breaking Barriers to WomenŐs Economic Inclusion in Saint Lucia;This note aims to identify gendered barriers to economic inclusion in Saint Lucia, barriers that not only harm the well-being of girls and women but work against economic growth and poverty reduction generally. The note further aims to inform policy developments in this area. Its underlying analysis assumes that gender gaps in employment and entrepreneurship are explained by barriers related to gaps in the accumulation of human capital, especially health and education, the misallocation of talent, and limitations in access to productive assets, including finance and land ownership.;Access to Jobs, Human Capital, Ownership and Use of Economic Assets;Caribbean;Report;The World Bank;Mar-23;De Paz Nieves, Carmen;http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099609103292337340/IDU0b1cdde56070e304ded0afff0973edf26d7be;Education, Productivity, Employment Access & Opportunities, Health;
Breaking Barriers to WomenŐs Economic Inclusion in GrenadaĘ;Grenada is a small upper-middle-income Caribbean Island with a young population, prone to natural disasters but also with an economy that is highly dependent on tourism. This policy note seeks to identify gendered barriers to economic inclusion in Grenada and to inform policy developments to promote progress in this area. Barriers to womenŐs economic participation not only hurt womenŐs well-being but also harm the countryŐs growth and poverty-reduction prospects. The analysis considers barriers related to gaps in the accumulation of human capital, the misallocation of talent, and limitations in access to productive assets, including land and finance. The overall finding is that improving gender equality in economic participation offers a promising pathway to recovery in Grenada, as demonstrated by other country experiences across the world and particularly in the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region.;Access to Jobs, Human Capital, Ownership and Use of Economic Assets;Caribbean;Report;The World Bank;Mar-23;De Paz Nieves, Carmen;https://documents.worldbank.org/pt/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099603503082357057/idu0d3d82498080b0049d80931b04db7448ac3d6;Education, Productivity, Employment Access & Opportunities, Poverty, Health;
Gender Diversity, Innovation, and Open Innovation in the Caribbean Region;The Caribbean economies are well-ranked in terms of womens participation in the labor market, but less so in terms of innovation, suggesting the relevance of an analysis of gender diversitys impact on innovation. This paper examines how gender diversity in Caribbean firm affects the formation of external partnerships and agreements for innovation, and also how the effects of that diversity on innovative outcomes are influenced by the presence of women in diverse positions within a firm. Using information for 13 Caribbean countries from the Innovation, Firm Productivity and Gender (IFPG) database, this study confirms gender diversity as a factor which both improves the likelihood of innovation, as well as spurring the decision to collaborate with other firms and organizations. However, impacts will depend on the areas within a firm in which women are present. Gender diversity in the total workforce and in production and non-production activities is more effective than when women are present in areas solely related to management. These findings prompt a reflection on policy implications around the definition or improvement of measures oriented to the closing of innovation-related gender gaps.;Access to Jobs, Other;Caribbean;Technical note;Inter-American Development Bank;Apr-23;"çlvarez, Isabel;ĘĘCastillo, Yury";http://dx.doi.org/10.18235/0004853;Productivity, Leadership & Management;
The Impact of the One-Stop Shop for Business Registration in the Dominican Republic;Digital one-stop shops for firm registration can significantly reduce costs and increase access to information for firms entering the formal sector. This paper examines the impact of a nationwide program with a one-stop registration shop and lower registration fees. In addition to analyzing its impact on the number of firms registering in the formal sector, this study explores how the program reshapes the labor market for women and men. The empirical setting, the Dominican Republic, is characterized by high levels of firm and labor informality. The government launched the digital one-stop shop called Formal’zate in 2013. To analyze its impact, this paper takes advantage of the sequential rollout of the program across provinces in the country. Results show that the launch of the program in a province is associated with a greater number of micro firms entering the formal market. Interestingly, these firms are concentrated in sectors in which informality was high prior to rollout of the program, especially the commerce and tourism sector. In addition, the results show that women's participation in the labor forced is impacted by the program, but men's participation is not. More specifically, the presence of Formal’zate increased women's participation in the labor market as self-employed entrepreneurs.;Access to and Use of Services;Caribbean;Working paper;Inter-American Development Bank;May-23;"Bobi_, Vida;  Delgado, Lucia;  Gerardino, Mar’a Paula; Hennessey, Michael;  Martinez-Carrasco, JosŽ";http://dx.doi.org/10.18235/0005089;Productivity, Informal Economic Activity, Private Sector, Digital Technologies & Services;
Gender Gaps in the English-speaking Caribbean: Education, Skills, and Wages;"This document contributes to the understanding of the reasons behind gender gaps in education and how they translate into labor market outcomes and trajectories in the English-speaking Caribbean. What are the main characteristics of these gaps? Are they observed through the entire life cycle? Do they grow over time? What factors can explain them? A detailed analysis of updated educational and labor market data for five countries of the English-speaking Caribbean - The Bahamas, Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago- complements previous studies by: (a) following the English-speaking Caribbean population from primary school to the labor market; (b) assessing the existence of gender gaps in education and in the labor market separately; and (c) analyzing the relationship between them and how one affects the other. The analysis confirms previously documented trends. Males tend to underachieve in terms of secondary and post-secondary studies when compared to females, as measured by enrollment, completion rates and learning outcomes. Our study analyses different factors that could be driving these gaps, such as gender roles, socialization processes for both girls and boys, classroom pedagogy in Caribbean schools, school curricula, and corporal punishment in households and schools. Despite females better results in education, their outcomes in the labor market are less favorable than those of males. Women show lower participation, and among labor market participants, they have higher unemployment rates and lower wages than men. For The Bahamas and Guyana, we document that wage gaps are primarily driven by non-observable characteristics unrelated to labor productivity. By contrast, in Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, wage gaps seem to be mainly driven by labor market experience, occupational rank, and industrial sector. Reductions in gender-based sectoral and occupational segregation could significantly close the wage gaps observed in the latter countries. We recommend the continued collection of timely and accurate disaggregated data to inform policymaking and positively impact inclusive and sustainable development.";Human Capital, Access to Jobs;Caribbean;Technical note;Inter-American Development Bank;May-23;"Thailinger, Agustina;ĘĘPecha, Camilo;ĘĘBeuermann, Diether; Arias Ortiz, Elena;ĘĘHobbs, Cynthia;ĘĘPiras, Claudia";http://dx.doi.org/10.18235/0004935;Education, Productivity, Gender Pay Gap, Norms, Youth;
Structural and Behavioral Barriers to Improving Development Outcomes: The Case of Maternal Care in Haiti;This paper investigates the interplay between structural and behavioral barriers that discourage pregnant women from accessing institutional care in Haiti, where despite some improvements in the past decades, maternal mortality remains a significant challenge. The analysis complements household survey data with data on service provision and qualitative data on beliefs, perceptions, and attitudes toward maternal health care. Using a mixed-methods approach, the paper confirms that transportation and poverty are important barriers that decrease the likelihood of attending maternal health care services. At the same time, the findings show that women suffer from optimism bias and are uncomfortable with the current model of received care. These barriers discourage women from seeking, reaching, and receiving maternal health care services at health institutions. Tackling structural barriers while finding ways to encourage women to shift their beliefs, perceptions, and attitudes are key recommendations to improve maternal health in Haiti.;Access to and Use of Services, Human Capital;Caribbean;Working paper;The World Bank;May-23;"Perge, Emilie Bernadette; Llopis Abella, Jimena; Fruttero, Anna";https://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-10421;Basic Services, Healthcare, Transportation & Mobility, Norms, Poverty;
The Rough Road to Services and Livelihood Opportunities in Rural Haiti and the Added Impact of Natural Disasters;Mobility of goods and people in rural Haiti is constrained by the sparce road network and low maintenance of existing infrastructure. These challenges are further exacerbated by frequent natural disasters, including seasonal floods and earthquakes of significant magnitudes. This study conducted household surveys, qualitative interviews with humanitarian and development organizations on the ground, and spatial and statistical analysis to understand the impact of the relative importance of various constraints to accessing schooling, health care, and livelihood opportunities in rural Haiti, especially focusing on the most marginalized population groups. The various data collected corroborate the conclusion that transport issuesŃtravel time, flooded roads, and lack of continuously functioning public transport services, among othersŃare central in the local residentsŐ ability to access services and livelihood opportunities. At the same time, for many marginalized people, such as women and people living with a disability, other significant barriers are present, in terms of lack of affordability, inappropriate design of school and health care facilities, risk of assault, discrimination, and cultural norms. Living in a community where roads where damaged by the August 2021 earthquake is associated with reduced odds of having accessed needed health care or sold any of the produced agricultural harvest in the following months and with higher odds of children having missed school. Overall, the findings point to the need for a broad set of interventionsŃcombining infrastructure and complementary policiesŃto allow everyone, including the most marginalized groups, to gain full access to health, education, and livelihood opportunities.;Access to and Use of Services;Caribbean;Working paper;World Bank Group;Aug-23;"Stokenberga, Aiga

Fiscal Policy as a Tool for Gender Equity in El Salvador;This paper analyzes fiscal incidence in El Salvador through a gender lens using the Commitment to Equity model. The study aims to identify fiscal policies that promote gender equality and facilitates evidence-based policy recommendations aimed at reducing gender disparities and promoting more inclusive fiscal policies. The analysis shows that fiscal policy is not pro-poor, as it can lead to a 3.1 percentage point increase in overall poverty using the US$6.85 2017 purchasing power parity poverty line, disproportionately impacting particular groups. Households headed by single women with at least one child under six years old experience a poverty rate increase of 4.3 percentage points, reaching an alarming rate of 42.7 percent. An increasing gender gap in poverty rates is also observed among households where women are the sole providers. The results show that the net fiscal system can increase the incidence of poverty among this group by 4.3 percentage points. In comparison, it increases by only 2.3 percentage points among their male counterparts. A microsimulation exercise of potential fiscal reforms to improve the welfare position of these households reveals that a fiscal package eliminating indirect subsidies, social security exemptions for vulnerable groups, and conditional cash transfers to households that meet certain conditions could reverse these unfavorable outcomes.;Access to and Use of Services, Other;Latin America;Working paper;The World Bank;Aug-23;"Robayo-Abril, Monica

The Anatomy of the Financial Inclusion Gap in the Caucasus and Central AsiaĘ;This paper analyses how financial inclusion in the Caucasus and Central Asia (CCA) compares to peers in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Using individual-level survey data, it shows that the probability of being financially included, as proxied by account ownership in financial institutions, is substantially lower across gender, income groups, and education levels in all CCA countries relative to CEE comparators. Key determinants of this financial inclusion gap are lower financial and human development indices, weak rule of law, and physical access to bank branches or ATMs. This suggests that targeted policies aimed at boosting financial and human development, strengthening the rule of law, and supporting fintech solutions can broaden financial inclusion in the CCA.;Access to and Use of Services, Human Capital;Central Asia;Working paper;International Monetary Fund;May-23;Poghosyan, Tigran;https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2023/English/wpiea2023109-print-pdf.ashx;Financial Services & Inclusion, Digital Technologies & Services;
Preferences for Wage Discrimination against Women;This study demonstrates systematic bias against women in public perceptions of the fairness of wages. In nationally representative survey experiments across more than 70,000 individual vignettes posed to 4,500 respondents in three Central Asian countries, respondents were 13 percent more likely to say wages were Ňtoo highÓ when the randomly assigned person described in the vignette (subject) was a woman, and 34 percent more likely to say they were Ňtoo lowÓ when the subject was a man. The pattern of bias favoring higher wages for men is statistically significant at conventional levels in all three countries, among both male and female respondents, and in each of the eight occupations studied. The results also demonstrate the presence of significant bias in favor or older workers, specifically for white-collar occupations, and the absence of this relationship for the blue-collar occupations included in the experiment. The findings reinforce the importance of bias as a contributing factor to the gender pay gap, and the value of equal pay regulations to prevent gender discrimination in wage setting.;Access to Jobs, Other;Central Asia;Working paper;The World Bank;Aug-23;Seitz, William;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/40256;Employment Access & Opportunities, Norms, Gender Pay Gap;

Learning from Entrepreneurship Programming for WomenŐs Economic Empowerment;"MUVA is a social incubator dedicated to developing innovative approaches to the economic empowerment of women in Mozambique. This paper documents experiences from two MUVA projects supporting womenŐs economic empowerment through entrepreneurship, and draws out broader insights and principles of relevance to other similar programmes. Barriers to womenŐs economic empowerment and strategies to overcome these barriers are both individual and systemic, visible and invisible.

MUVAŐs approach to supporting womenŐs economic empowerment through entrepreneurship involves tailoring three core elements to the specific context of different profiles of women business owners, including urban informal vegetable and fruit traders (MUVA+) and owners of small businesses with untapped growth potential (PAM). Both are groups of low-income female entrepreneurs that are rarely eligible for acceleration and entrepreneurship support. Core programme elements are technical skills, personal development and opportunity generation.

However, the project results show that no particular intervention generates impact. Rather, what generates impact is how interventions are tailored to entrepreneursŐ specific business needs, responding to both the external context and internal constraints each group faces, through adapting methodologies that are more often used by formal businesses and policymakers. To achieve this, MUVA bundled interventions in ways that address both visible and invisible barriers and opportunities.";Access to Jobs;East Africa;Article;Institute for Development Studies;Jun-23;"Thorpe, J.; Ault, A.; Barenboim, I.; Guimar‹es, L.; Quak, E-J. and Taela, KĘ";10.19088/MUVA.2023.001;Productivity, Entrepreneurship;
Women in Ethiopian Tax Administration: Evidence on Representation and Performance;"In the growing body of research on gender and taxation in low-income countries, the implications of having more women in tax administration have received relatively little attention. Using data from employee records and key informant interviews, we examine the representation of women in the workforce of the Ethiopian tax administration, as well as their performance and their misconduct.
The findings show that women dominate the overall workforce in most branch offices. However, women overwhelmingly occupy lower ranked positions and their engagement at the top level of management is quite limited. Our analysis of gender-disaggregated employee performance scores indicates that there is no conclusive evidence to claim women perform better than men employees, though most of the key informants tend to believe otherwise.

However, misconduct records present a strong case that women employees are less likely to commit serious disciplinary misconduct, such as corruption and breaching trust, and more likely to serve for a longer number of years compared to men employees. We also present cross-country comparisons with Uganda and other ATAF member countries.

Rebel with a Cause: Effects of a Gender Norms Intervention for Adolescents in Somalia;Gender inequality and restrictive norms are often reinforced and internalized during adolescence, influencing pivotal life choices. This paper presents results from a randomly-assigned gender norms intervention for young adolescents in Somalia that led to greater support for gender equality in reported attitudes among both girls and boys. In a novel lab-in-the-field experiment designed to observe social group dynamics, treated adolescents were also found to be less likely to succumb to peer pressure to conform when stating their gender attitudes in public. Perceptions of gender norms appears to shift for boys, leading to a greater public expression of gender egalitarian ideals. Furthermore, the findings show improved adolescent mental health, increased caring behavior towards siblings of the opposite sex, and a higher likelihood of involvement in household chores by boys.

What Happens When Employers Can No Longer Discriminate in Job Ads?;"When employers' explicit gender requests were unexpectedly removed from a Chinese job board overnight, pools of successful applicants became more integrated: women's (men's) share of callbacks to jobs that had requested men (women) rose by 61 (146) percent. The removal ""worked"" in this sense because it generated a large increase in gender-mismatched applications, and because those applications were treated surprisingly well by employers, suggesting that employers' gender requests often represented relatively weak preferences or outdated stereotypes. The job titles that were integrated by the ban, however, were not the most gendered ones, and were disproportionately lower-wage jobs.";Access to Jobs;East Asia;Article;America Economic Review;Apr-23;Peter Kuhn,ĘKailing Shen;10.1257/aer.20211127;Employment Access & Opportunities, Norms;
Fertility, Son-Preference, and the Reversal of the Gender Gap in Literacy/Numeracy Tests;This study examines the relationship between fertility decline and the reversal/narrowing of the gender gap in literacy/numeracy test scores. Drawing on Becker's Quantity-Quality (Q-Q) trade-off model, we propose that in a society such as China, where son-preference is prevalent, the Q-Q trade-off would be larger for daughters than that for sons. An exogenous reduction of fertility would make girls more likely to live in a single-sex family, which in turn increases the share of human capital investment for girls. We test this empirically. To consider the endogenous nature of the demand for children, we exploit an exogenous variation in fertility due to China's family planning policy. Utilising the policy intensity information collected from hundreds of county gazetteers to construct a novel instrument for fertility, we find that a reduction in one sibling narrows the gender gap in numeracy and literacy test scores by 14.8% and 21.4% of a standard deviation in the rural sample and 4.0% and 6.5% in the urban sample. The pattern is more pronounced in regions with a higher proportion of people who prefer a son over a daughter. We also provide suggestive evidence that the channel of the effect is indeed largely through the increased probability of girls living in single-sex families.;Human Capital;East Asia;Discussion paper;IZA;Jun-23;Minhee Chae, Xin Meng, Sen Xue;https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/16208/fertility-son-preference-and-the-reversal-of-the-gender-gap-in-literacynumeracy-tests;Health, Education;
Gender Analysis of Social Security and Welfare Public Policies in the Republic of Moldova;The paper is dedicated to the study of the process of gender analysis of public spending allocated by the Government to the needs of the ordinary citizens. This must be applied in the form of regular payments or allowances, which will not contain discrimination by first of all, gender, experience, field of activity or other factors. The main objective of this work is to study the gender budgeting initiatives, all their forms, their primary purpose and influence on the budget process, in order to help policymakers focus on how public policies can help reduce gender disparities and improve economic outcomes. The paper is divided into: introduction, 3 chapters, conclusion and annexes. The introduction details the main purpose of the work set for the author, its relevance, the objectives and impact on the current world situation. The 1st chapter relates to the study of the theoretical foundations of the formation of gender analysis, its essence and methodologies of effective report concluding. For the 2nd chapter, the author performs an analysis of the normative and institutional framework for regulating gender equality and the budgetary process in the Republic of Moldova. The author denotes policies and strategies in the domain of social security and welfare in the Republic of Moldova, as well as the dynamics of the main indicators over the related period. In the 3rd chapter, there are brought down the dynamics of main indicators, which provide clear image to the degree of social justice and welfare in the Republic of Moldova. Judging by the obtained results, respective commentaries have been utilized. Conclusion represents an accurate summary of the performed paper and contains a cluster of recommendations for improving the current situation in the field of public expenditures for assuring social security and welfare.;Access to and Use of Services;Eastern Europe;Article;SSRN;Feb-23;Andrei Petroia;http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4371914;Fiscal Policy;
Small gender differences that become large: The role of competition;Gender differences in competition may help explain gender gaps in labour market outcomes. Performance data from chess competitions shows a minimal gender gap at the individual (micro) level but a large macro gender difference.

Gender differences in motivation to engage in platform work;"Platform work together with other new forms of employment are gaining ground in the European labour market. Although the share of women platform workers has been rising in recent years, they remain under-represented in platform work.

Women are more likely to engage in platform work to gain an additional income and to have flexibility with the specific aim of combining work with family commitments.

In contrast, men are more likely to engage in platform work due to opportunities to work globally and expand their client base to different cities or countries.

The Wage Effect of Workplace Sexual Harassment: Evidence for Women in Europe;"This article contributes to the literature on wage discrimination by examining the consequences of sexual harassment in the workplace on wages for women in Europe. We model the empirical relationship between sexual harassment risk and wages for European women employees using individual-level data provided by the European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS, Eurostat). We find that sexual harassment risk has a negative and statistically significant effect on wages of -0.03% on average for women in Europe. However, our empirical analysis uncovers the importance of considering the dynamics of workplace power relations: analyzing individual-level data, we find evidence of a higher negative impact of sexual harassment risk on wages for women working in counter-stereotypical occupations.Ę

Violence Against Women at Work;In this paper, we link every police report in Finland to administrative data to identify violence between colleagues, and the economic consequences for victims, perpetrators, and firms. This new approach to observe when one colleague attacks another overcomes previous data constraints limiting evidence on this phenomenon to self-reported surveys that do not identify perpetrators. We document large, persistent labor market impacts of between-colleague violence on victims and perpetrators. Male perpetrators experience substantially weaker consequences after attacking female colleagues. PerpetratorsŐ relative economic power in male-female violence partly explains this asymmetry. Turning to broader implications for firm recruitment and retention, we find that male-female violence causes a decline in the proportion of women at the firm, both because fewer new women are hired and current female employees leave. Management plays a key role in mediating the impacts on the wider workforce. Only male-managed firms lose women. Female-managed firms exhibit a key difference relative to male-managed firms: male perpetrators are less likely to remain employed after attacking their female colleagues.;Leadership, Gender-Based Violence (GBV);Europe;Article;The Quarterly Journal of Economics ;Sep-23;Abi Adams-Prassl and others;https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjad045;Leadership & Management;
How families matter for understanding economic inequality;In this paper we discuss the importance of families for understanding economic inequality. Family structure can in principle be an amplifier or mitigator of economic inequality. We describe three channels on how families shape economic inequality. First, how people match to form families matters for inequality across families. Second, parental investments in children can amplify existing inequalities across generations. Third, inequality can exist even within families, and the economic environment can shape inequality in consumption and leisure between spouses. In this survey we describe these channels and discuss the related literature.;Human Capital;Europe;Working paper;Inter-American Development Bank;Sep-23;"Santos, Cezar;  Tertilt, MichŹle";http://dx.doi.org/10.18235/0005124;Norms;

Addressing Gender Inequalities in Countries Affected by Fragility, Conflict, and Violence: An Evaluation of the World Bank GroupŐs Support;Conflict and fragility increase the exposure of women and girls to gender-based violence (GBV) and make it more difficult for them to access social services, including sexual and reproductive health services. Fragility, conflict, and violence (FCV) also exacerbate their vulnerability to poverty and increase their unpaid work burden from their caregiving role. The increase of situations of fragility and conflict in recent years has called the World Bank Group to step up its engagement in these contexts and to adapt its approach to address gender inequalities in FCV countries. The Bank Group recognizes in many corporate and strategic documents, such as the 2020-2025 FCV strategy, that for Bank Group support to produce meaningful and lasting results toward greater gender equality in FCV countries, it needs to have five specific elements. These elements include relevance, depth, sustainability, scale, and inclusive ownership. The evaluation uses these elements to assess the Bank Group's country support for women's and girls' economic empowerment (WGEE) and GBV prevention and response. The evaluation analyzes in depth the experiences of six countries (Burkina Faso, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Lebanon, the Solomon Islands, and the Republic of Yemen) where the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) provided support to advance WGEE and address GBV during the past 10 years. The report draws on a combination of in-depth desk review of documents, more than 200 interviews of World Bank and IFC staff, government partners, and national and international stakeholders, and field visits, focus group discussions, and face-to-face interviews in.

The Gig Economy and Financial Inclusion of Women in Latin America;"The development and expansion of platforms, as an opportunity to identify and connect labor demand and supply, has generated favorable expectations of job opportunities for less integrated groups such as women. This expansion, however, raises questions about the generation of sustainable income and opportunities for job stabilization and formalization. How should we leverage digital channels to improve women's financial inclusion? What is their financial profile and their demand for financing in platforms in the region? Is it possible for these platforms to be a solution in situations of economic vulnerability? Financial inclusion goes hand-in-hand with financial development and remains a challenge for Latin America. This paper follows a novel path by focusing on the conditions associated with gig economy women workers in the household services segment, as surveyed in four Latin American countries. The results show that gig economy platforms: i) have the potential to contribute to improving women's financial inclusion; ii) enable an ""activity effect"" and a ""formalization effect""; and iii) identify lack of trust in payment instruments as the main obstacle to improve financial inclusion.";Access to Jobs, Ownership and Use of Economic Assets;Latin America;Technical note;Inter-American Development Bank;Feb-23;"Fern‡ndez D’ez, Mar’a Carmen;  T‡mola, Alejandro;  Azar Barros, Karina; Herrera, Diego;  Coloma, Mar’a Gabriela;  Andrade, Gabriela";http://dx.doi.org/10.18235/0004755;Financial Services & Inclusion, Digital Technologies & Services, Employment Access & Opportunities;
The Gender Earnings Gap in Latin America and the Caribbean: An analysis of its components;This study analyzes gender earnings gap in 18 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. It finds a significant difference in hourly earnings between men and women in most of the region. It also finds that while women should be earning more per hour than men based on their level of education, the economic sectors in which they work, their occupations, the setting in which they live (urban/rural), and their personal characteristics, they do not, in reality, earn more. The earnings gap favoring men is therefore due to factors that are not explained by the variables used in this study and are rather due to unobservable characteristics associated with discriminatory gender biases. These biases may be cognitive or rooted in poorly designed laws, discrimination, or labor costs related to child-rearing that are overlooked by society. This analysis uses data from the household surveys harmonized by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and it uses two models to estimate the gender earnings gap: the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition and the Nopo decomposition.;Other;Latin America;Technical note;Inter-American Development Bank;Mar-23;"Urquidi, Manuel;ĘĘChalup, Miguel";http://dx.doi.org/10.18235/0004785;Employment Access & Opportunities, Gender Pay Gap, Norms;
Inclusi—n financiera con enfoque de gŽnero y datos desagregados por sexo en las mipymes argentinas;En 2020 las empresas de mujeres representaban el 33% de las micro, peque–as y medianas empresas (mipymes) argentinas.

Gender Gaps and Family Leaves in Latin America;Gender equality in the labor market remains a difficult challenge in Latin America and recent literature shows that child penalties play an important role in explaining these gaps. While policies to address gaps related to parenthood were introduced in recent decades, evidence of its effects is still scarce. This paper presents comparable evidence on the adoption of family leaves legislation in 15 Latin American countries and discusses its relationship with the evolution of the gender gaps in the labor market and the prevailing gender norms. We document that from 2000 to 2019 almost all countries increased the weeks covered by maternity, paternity, or parental leaves. Following a similar approach to that of Olivetti and Petrongolo (2017), we exploit the variations over time and control for country and year-fixed effects to study the relationship between the extension of family leaves and womenŐs outcomes. We find that these policies are successful in increasing female employment and reducing employment gaps in countries departing from a worse situation in terms of leave coverage or with more traditional perceptions of gender roles. On the other hand, for countries with more egalitarian gender perceptions, our results suggest that the extension of family leaves contributes to reduce the income gaps.;Access to Jobs;Latin America;Article;Review of Economics of the Household;Jul-23;Estefan’a Galv‡n, Cecilia Parada, Martina Querejeta & Soledad SalvadorĘ;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-023-09671-9;Care, Gender Pay Gap, Basic Services, Norms, Employment Access & Opportunities;
Revisiting food insecurity gender disparity;Previous research has shown that woman-headed households, more than man-headed ones, experience food insecurity. The purpose of this article is to contribute on the determinants that are linked to this gender disparity. Using a nationally representative dataset from Chile, we found that food security household head gender disparity is associated with marital status (having or not a partner) and household composition (having children or seniors). In contrast, gender disparity is not strongly associated with household income and household head educational differences. In this way, we expect to bring evidence to inform new alternatives that help mitigate food security gender disparity.;Human Capital, Other;Latin America;Article;PLoS ONE;Aug-23;Andres Silva , Andres Astorga, Rodrigo Faundez, Karla Santos;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287593;Health, Other;
Caregivers on the move: Gender and socioeconomic status in the care mobility in Bogot‡;The concept of mobility of care is relatively new and generating growing interest, because it allows a greater understanding of daily mobility and the differences in time use (TU) and unpaid workloads in the population. There is a large unexplored field of study in the relationships between the socioeconomic and gender characteristics of the population and care trips in large Latin American cities. This study uses the Mobility Survey for Bogot‡ _ 2019 to characterizes travel for caregivers in the city, identifying trips made for care reasons, and then relating the analysis to variables of gender, age, socioeconomic status, occupation, and time and mode of transport used, in order to highlight and deepen the understanding of interdependence relationships between caregivers and care receivers. Results show that care work and care trips are carried out mostly by women, and we also find an unequal burden among caregivers and their socioeconomic conditions, with the lower strata population assuming a greater burden for care trips and time use when caring for others. Our findings contribute to the understanding of a phenomenon of growing importance and allow progress in the design and implementation of public policies towards a triple objective: transparency for care tasks and mobility, facilitation of their execution, and minimizing gender and socioeconomic status inequalities.;Access to and Use of Services;Latin America;Article;Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives;Sep-23;Jimena Murillo-Munar, Irene G—mez-Varo, Oriol MarquetĘ;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trip.2023.100884;Transportation & Mobility, Care;
Preventing and Addressing Gender-Based Violence;Violence against women and girls (VAWG) is widely recognized as an impediment to the social and economic development of communities and States and the achievement of the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Experiencing violence precludes women from contributing to and benefiting from development initiatives by limiting their agency, that is, their choices and ability to act. The deprivation of women resulting from VAWG should be of central concern to governments as an intrinsic human rights issue and due to its impact on economic growth and poverty reduction. Child marriage - a form of violence against women - epitomizes a profound lack of voice and agency and affects multiple areas of a girlŐs life by lowering her education, increasing her fertility, reducing her labor force participation, and curtailing her future earnings prospects. Addressing violence against women and girls requires a comprehensive combination of prevention and protection measures involving a multi-level, multi-stakeholder approach, and sustained engagement leveraging various sector entries. The most effective initiatives address underlying risk factors for violence, including social norms regarding gender roles and the acceptability of violence. A 2020 meta-analysis of 104 rigorous impact evaluations of interventions to prevent womenŐs experience and menŐs perpetration of physical and or sexual intimate partner violence and non-partner sexual violence shows that nine categories of interventions were effective in reducing VAWG, including cash transfers or economic empowerment programs for women when combined with group discussions on VAWG and gender transformative programming, couplesŐ interventions, parenting programs to prevent domestic violence and child maltreatment, community activism to shift harmful gender norms, and school-based intervention to prevent dating violence. In Latin America and Caribbean (LAC), the World Bank has engaged with countries and partners to support the integration of VAWG components in sector-specific projects in areas such as transport, education, social protection, and forced displacement. Projects have integrated measures to prevent and respond to VAWG through improved access to justice and services, implementation of communications campaigns, training, safeguards, and enhanced national data systems.;Gender-Based Violence (GBV);Caribbean, Latin America;Brief;The World Bank;Feb-23;World Bank;http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/572881642747429387/Preventing-and-Addressing-Gender-Based-Violence;Gender-Based Violence (GBV), Norms, Care;

Willing but Unable to Pay?: The Role of Gender in Tax Compliance;"The existing literature shows that women are more likely to pay taxes than men. Yet, there is less consensus on the gendered responses to interventions aimed at boosting tax compliance among non-payers. In this study, we exploit a field experiment designed to increase property tax compliance to investigate this gender disparity. Our findings reaffirm that women are typically more diligent in paying their taxes than men. Interestingly, while the receipt of a deterrence letter prompts women to pay earlier, it does not necessarily augment their overall compliance. Conversely, men, upon receiving a deterrence letter, show a marked improvement in overall compliance. We also find that the size of the tax bill influences women's compliance behavior (the likelihood of paying'increases substantially for small bills), but not men's. To unpack this intriguing finding, we examine survey data to uncover the differing motivations and resources between
genders. This analysis suggests that, although women may be more motivated to pay, they might encounter significant liquidity constraints. Our observations are consistent with a simple analytical model that correlates compliance to tax morale, risk aversion, and budget constraints. This research underscores the potential for tax policies and enforcement procedures to exacerbate income inequality between genders, especially in low tax-enforcement contexts where tax evasion is substantial.";Other;Latin America, Caribbean;Working paper;Inter-American Development Bank;Jul-23;"L—pez-Luzuriaga, Andrea;ĘĘScartascini, Carlos";http://dx.doi.org/10.18235/0005031;Fiscal Policy, Norms;
Can Online Platforms Promote Women-Led Exporting Firms?;How can policymakers promote women-led exporting firms? In this paper, we study the role of online business platforms to reduce informational barriers to exporting for women entrepreneurs. We hypothesize that, if the costs associated with accessing digital platforms are more symmetric across gender than traditional trade costs, digital trade platforms can play an important role in making trade more gender equal. To assess this hypothesis, we combine information on firms' participation in ConnectAmericas , a free and purely informational online platform, and detailed firm level export data of a developing country over a long period. We find that participation in this platform is associated with a significantly larger increase in exports for women entrepreneurs than for men managed firms in otherwise identical products and destinations. Given existing evidence on the role of women managed businesses in reducing gender earnings inequality, these results suggest that policies which encourage women participation in online environments to reduce the informational barriers associated with operating in foreign markets have the capacity to promote gender equality more broadly.;Ownership and Use of Economic Assets, Access to Jobs;Caribbean, Latin America;Working paper;Inter-American Development Bank;Aug-23;"Poole, Jennifer P.;  Volpe Martincus, Christian";http://dx.doi.org/10.18235/0005061;Digital Technologies & Services, Entrepreneurship;
Caring for Caregivers: The Landscape of Paid Care Work in Latin America and the Caribbean;Paid care work will represent an important source of employment in coming decades, as care dependence becomes more prevalent, care needs evolve, and the structure of households changes. But there is little systematic data on the care economy for paid caregivers in Latin America and the Caribbean. This report aims to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying the paid care workforce in the region and describing its sociodemographic and economic profile in 17 countries. Using the most recent pre-pandemic microdata from labor and household surveys, the report examines the care economy for care workers who serve children and adults. The study concludes that there are approximately 8.9 million paid caregivers in the region, including 5.8 million paid workers who take care of children and 3.1 million who look after older people and people with disabilities. Most professionals in the sector are women in their early forties with a secondary-level education and with limited access to social protection benefits. This paper contributes to the ongoing discussion on paid and unpaid care work by emphasizing the importance of supporting a thriving workforce in the region while redistributing the burden of care in all dimensions of human life.;Access to and Use of Services, Other;Caribbean, Latin America;Technical note;Inter-American Development Bank;Sep-23;Fabiani, Beatrice;http://dx.doi.org/10.18235/0005147;Care, Employment Access & Opportunities, Social Protection;

The ABCs of the Role of Public Transport in WomenŐs Economic Empowerment;"There is increasing recognition that deficiencies in the public transport system impact men and women differently. While transport systems have been shown to play a significant role in womenŐs participation in the labor force globally, this topic has been little explored in the Middle East and North Africa. This paper examines the effect of the spatial accessibility, availability, and safety of public transportation on womenŐs labor market outcomes in three capital cities in the Middle East and North AfricaŃAmman in Jordan, Beirut in Lebanon, and Cairo in the Arab Republic of Egypt. The analysis uses three types of data collected for each city in 2022, namely, household mobility surveys, transit network data, and built environment audits. The paper investigates how the spatial accessibility of jobs in each city, the availability of public transportation close to residential locations, and the safety of public transit stops affect the labor force participation of women and their likelihood of employment. The main findings are that: (a) accessibility, availability, and safety appear to impact womenŐs labor force participation differentially in each city, and these impacts also vary by income level; and (b) although accessibility, availability, and safety appear to impact womenŐs labor force participation, they have overall little impact on womenŐs employment probability. The paper takes these two findings to imply that: (a) a one-size-fits-all-women solution is not appropriate when designing public transport systems; and (b) although public transport plays a critical role in improving womenŐs access to employment opportunities, complementary actions are needed to translate these gains into gainful employment.";Access to and Use of Services, Access to Jobs;Middle East, North Africa;Working paper;The World Bank;Apr-23;"Alam, Muneeza Mehmood

Revitalizing Women's Labor Force Participation in North Africa: An Exploration of Novel Empowerment Pathways;This paper explores new pathways to women's empowerment, including household structure, family support, satisfaction and self-esteem, and trust in institutions and politicians, and their impact on labor market participation, with a specific focus on gender differences. Using a microeconomic database of 7,860 individuals from North Africa and employing a Probit model, we find that gender significantly influences labor market participation. Surprisingly, our results reveal that education operates in an unexpected direction in the North African region, confirming the ŇMENA paradoxÓ. Moreover, household structure's impact on labor decisions varies by gender, as gender norms prevalent in male-dominated societies hinder women's labor market participation, leading to a Ňmarriage penalty.Ó In a similar vein, our estimations reveal a significant positive correlation between men's belief that Ňmen should have greater job rights than women during scarce work periodsÓ and their labor force participation, shedding light on the influential role of gender norms in North Africa. Our study emphasizes the critical role of networking, social capital, and how North Africans' perception of political life impedes their labor force participation. As for policy implications, our contribution illuminates new pathways for women's empowerment, advocating for comprehensive legislative reforms to promote gender equality and foster inclusive development.;Access to Jobs, Other;North Africa;Article;Policy Center for the New South;Jul-23;Aomar IbourkĘĘZakaria Elouaourti;https://doi.org/10.1080/10168737.2023.2227161;Employment Access & Opportunities, Productivity, Norms, Education, Economic Empowerment;

The Role of Structural Fiscal Policy on Female Labor Force Participation in OECD CountriesĘ;This paper examines the role of structural fiscal policies to promote female labor force participation and reduce gender gaps in labor markets in 26 OECD countries from 2000 to 2019. As both female labor force participation and many explanatory/control variables clearly exhibit non-stationarity (potentially leading to spurious regression results), we employ a panel vector error-correction model, in contrast with most previous empirical studies on this matter. Our analyses confirm statistically significant positive impacts of government spending on (1) early childcare and education, (2) active labor market programs, and (3) unemployment benefits, all of which would help encourage women to enter the labor force, while (4) an increase in relative tax rate on second earner could have negative impact on female labor force participation.;Access to and Use of Services, Access to Jobs;OECD;Working paper;International Monetary Fund;Sep-23;"Asai, Miyoko ; Chen, Qiaoe ; Honda, Jiro ; Hu, Xingwei ; Zhang, Qianqian";https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2023/English/wpiea2023186-print-pdf.ashx;Employment Access & Opportunities, Fiscal Policy;

The report compares gender gaps in labour and educational outcomes in Colombia with other countries. Particular attention is put on the uneven distribution of unpaid work, and the extra burden this places on women. It investigates how policies and programmes in Colombia can make this distribution more equitable. The first part of the report reviews the evidence on gender gaps and on what causes these, including the role played by attitudes. The second part develops a comprehensive framework to address these challenges, presenting a broad range of options to reduce the unpaid work burden falling on women, and to increase womenŐs labour income.

Does Co-Residence with Parents-In-Law Reduce Women's Employment In India?;We examine the effect of co-residence with fathers- and mothers-in-law on married womenŐs employment in India. Instrumental variable fixed effects estimates using two different household panel datasets indicate that co-residence with a father-in-law reduces married womenŐs employment by 11-13%, while co-residence with a mother-in-law has no effect. Difference-in-difference estimates show that married womenŐs employment increases following the death of a co-residing father-in-law, but not mother-in-law. We investigate three classes of explanations for this: income effects, increased domestic responsibilities, and social norms.

Religious Institutions and Gendered Time Use: Evidence from Ramadan Festivities in India;How does religious institutions bear upon the gender-gap in time use for individuals? In this paper we examine how religious mandates of the holy month of Ramadan affects the gendered distribution of time use within Muslim households in India. Using rich data from a nationally representative time use survey we construct a composite measure of gendered life that incorporates gender gaps. We employ a difference-in-difference methodology to test if this gender imbalance in accentuated by Ramadan. We find that contrary to popular belief, Ramadan moderates the gender disparities in intra-household time use for Muslim households. The moderating influence is stronger in districts with a higher Muslim proportion. We find a reduction in absolute gender gap in time use for employment, unpaid domestic work and learning activities. However, at an individual level, men and women in different age groups are differentially affected by Ramadan.;Other;South Asia;Article;SSRN;Jan-23;Dasgupta, Aparajita and Datta, Ashokankur;http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4329286;Norms, Care;

Women in the Workforce in Quetta: Results from the Quetta Urban Household Survey - Pakistan Gender and Social Inclusion Platform and Poverty and Equity Program;PakistanŐs female labor force participation (FLFP) remains low by regional and global standards. Furthermore, data show major disparities between rural and urban FLFP, with the latter being significantly lower. This note contains analysis of womenŐs labor market outcomes as reported by women in the city of Quetta, Balochistan Province, using data from the World BankŐs 2021 Quetta Urban Household Sur vey (QUHS). The multipurpose QUHS (as well as a similar survey conducted in urban Peshawar in 2020) at tempts to improve measurement of FLFP by collecting information on labor market outcomes directly from all working-age household members. Hence, in terms of implementation, it differs from standard labor force surveys (LFSs) in Pakistan that use one or two proxy respondents to report for other household members. It also increases the number of questions that directly list all possible forms of female employment. Finally, it allows for a more comprehensive definition of employment by accounting for production of goods for family use. Self-reporting of labor status in the QUHS allows for more accurate estimates of FLFP in urban Pakistan compared to what is reported in the most recent LFS. According to benchmarks from different subsamples in the 2020Đ21 LFS, the FLFP estimates from the QUHS always yield higher rates of FLFP (16.1 percent). The difference between the FLFP estimates in the two surveys is significant at the 99 percent level. On the contrary, in the case of men, the difference in estimates of labor force participation between the surveys is smaller and not always significant. When production of goods for family use is included in the accounting of female employment, FLFP increases by a small margin (17.6 percent). The employment profile of women in urban Quetta shows that they are mostly employed in low-value-added activities, mainly manufacturing, as garment and handicraft workers, and display a higher prevalence of own-account, informal, and home-based work. Men, on the contrary, are mostly paid employees. Moreover, womenŐs jobs are in line with socially accepted occupations, likely a function of how easily these jobs can be done from home. Over 78 percent of employed women in urban Quetta are home-based workers who work on their own account and have low chances of upward mobility. These results are in line with figures for urban Peshawar and urban Pakistan. The observed low level of FLFP and the nature of the profile of female employment in urban Pakistan are explained by factors such as low human capital endowment, lack of agency in various aspects of life, limited mobility, safety concerns, deep-rooted patriarchal norms, stereotypes about womenŐs role in the household, time devoted to unpaid care and household work, and lack of information about labor market opportunities.;Access to Jobs;South Asia;Working paper;World Bank Group;Apr-23;World Bank Group;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/39704;Employment Access & Opportunities, Care, Informal Economic Activity, Productivity, Norms;
Entitled to Property: How Breaking the Gender Barrier Improves Child Health in India;Non-unitary household models suggest that enhancing women's bargaining power can influence child health, a crucial determinant of human capital and economic standing throughout adulthood. We examine the effects of a policy shift, the Hindu Succession Act Amendment (HSAA), which granted inheritance rights to unmarried women in India, on child health. Our findings indicate that the HSAA improved children's height and weight. Furthermore, we uncover evidence supporting a mechanism whereby the policy bolstered women's intra-household bargaining power, resulting in downstream benefits through enhanced parental care for children and improved child health. These results emphasize that children fare better when mothers control a larger share of family resources.

What Do We Know About Interventions to Increase WomenŐs Economic Participation and Empowerment in South Asia: Care Polices and Care Services;The Care category covers interventions and mandates that reduce the care burden on women and, consequently, enable them to participate as active economic agents. For the review, care responsibilities are defined as activities that keep women engaged in looking after members of their household. Particularly, the review explores care activities that prevent women of working age from entering the labor force, both at the extensive and intensive margins. Household care activities include childcare, elder care, and care for the sick and disabled. The research for this review accounts for interventions that reduce this burden of care on women and enable them to enter or re-enter the work force. First, this includes childcare servicesŃthose provided by the government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), private and employer-provided, or supported onsite childcare. Second, it accounts for policies or mandates that provide women with care services and childcare mandates. It also includes additional mandates that provide families with tax breaks, vouchers, and subsidy benefits to help with care responsibilities, and it accounts for labor market regulations, such as leave, family-friendly policies, and arrangements. Lastly, the review excludes policies or programs that provide education to school-age children beyond the pre-school level.;Other, Access to and Use of Services, Access to Jobs;South Asia;Brief;The World Bank;Jul-23;"Zahra, Najaf; Javed, Amna; Munoz Boudet, Ana Maria";https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/40080;Care, Employment Access & Opportunities, Basic Services, Social Protection;
Why Do People Move?: A Data-Driven Approach to Identifying and Predicting Gender-Specific Aspirations to Migrate;Work-related migration has many potential drivers. While current literature has outlined a theoretical framework of various Ňpush-pullÓ factors affecting the likelihood of international migration, empirical papers are often constrained by the scarcity of detailed data on migration, especially in developing countries, and are forced to look at few of these factors in isolation. When detailed data is available, researchers may face arbitrary choices of which variables to include and how to sequence their inclusion. As male and female migrants tend to face occupational segregation, the determinants of migration likely differ by gender, which compounds these data challenges. To overcome these three issues, this paper uses a rich primary household survey among migrant communities in Indonesia and employs two supervised machine-learning methods to identify the top predictors of migration by gender: random forests and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator stability selection. The paper confirms some determinants established by earlier studies and reveals several additional ones, as well as identifies differences in predictors by gender.;Access to Jobs;Southeast Asia;Working paper;The World Bank;Apr-23;"Halim, Daniel

Gender disparities in financial resilience: insights from South Africa;"Purpose
While the extant literature has explored issues related to the access, usage and availability of financial services, the ability of households to withstand financial adversities, particularly those living under economically vulnerable conditions, requires further attention. The paper presents a gendered analysis of financial resilience behaviour in South Africa.
Design/methodology/approach
Using a nationally representative sample of 4,880 households, this paper constructs a financial resilience behaviour index (FRBI) covering savings, credit, insurance, and retirement planning behaviours. The gendered effect of demographic characteristics on financial resilience is examined using the ordinary least square and seemingly unrelated regression techniques.
Findings
The results show that low levels of financial resilience were present across the sample with insurance observed to be the greatest driver of financial resilience, followed by retirement planning, savings and credit respectively. Furthermore, the analysis highlights that a gender gap in financial resilience exists as men are characterized with higher financial resilience behaviour compared to women. The results also suggest that employed women and women with higher levels of education are associated with greater financial resilience.";Access to and Use of Services;Southern Africa;Article;International Journal of Bank Marketing;Jul-23;Zeka, B. and Alhassan, A.L.;https://doi.org/10.1108/IJBM-01-2023-0053;External Shocks, Financial Services & Inclusion, Social Protection, Economic Empowerment;
Navigating Education, Motherhood, and Informal Labor: The Experiences of Young Women in Luanda;Gender equality is a key foundation of inclusive and sustainable economic development that can translate into long-term and effective poverty reduction. While gender equality matters on its own as a human right, it also offers instrumental value for individuals, households, and societies at large. Global evidence consistently shows that empowering women and girls reduces poverty incidence and food insecurity, boosts economic growth and productivity, and enhances investments in childrenŐs human capital. Angola, a country where a third of the population lives in poverty and economic output is heavily dependent on its oil sector, stands out in Sub-Saharan Africa for its particularly large gender disparities, especially when compared to countries of same income levels. Family formation, education, and labor market decisions are intrinsically interwoven and connected, which in the case of Angola leads to extreme demographic pressure on an already weak public service system. To begin tackling these significant gender disparities, well-designed and targeted policies are needed. But there are significant knowledge gaps when it comes to understanding the key barriers facing Angolan girls and young women in accessing education and transitioning to the labor market. This report presents insights gained from the voices of young women and girls, their parents, and key informants through a series of interviews carried out in Luanda, home to a quarter of the countryŐs population, in 2022. Based on these in-depth interviews with low-income young women in Luanda, this report points to the multiple challenges they face across their life cycle - challenges relating to the dimensions of education, family formation, and work. It also shows how those dimensions in a womanŐs life are deeply interconnected - and how they are determined by structural constraints including poverty and vulnerability, gender norms, corruption and lack of transparency in access to services and opportunities, and violence in public and private spheres.;Human Capital, Access to Jobs;Southern Africa;Brief;The World Bank;Sep-23;"Machado, Ana Luiza; Kalle,ĘĘAlina;Muller, Miriam";https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/40401;Youth, Education, Norms, Employment Access & Opportunities;

Very few studies have considered assessing the effectiveness of these programmes from a distributive perspective. This study uses nationally representative data from the Zimbabwe demographic and health survey complemented with geographic location data. As a first step, the empirical approach quantifies wealth-related inequalities in selected maternal and child health outcomes using concentration indices at the district level. A standard difference-in-difference model complemented by kernel-based propensity score matching was used to consistently estimate the impact of the RBF programme on the equality of maternal and child health outcomes across socioeconomic gradients in Zimbabwe by comparing the changes in concentration indices between 2010 and 2015 in ten districts with RBF and thirty districts without the RBF programme for 12 indicators of access to maternal health care and nine indicators of child healthĘĘoutcomes. The results show that the RBF programme was associated with greater and significant improvements in equity related to several outcomes. These outcomes included: prenatal care use (four or more prenatal care visits), family planning, quality of prenatal care (blood pressure checks, iron tablets, and tetanus toxoid vaccinations), child full immunizations, and treatment for fever occurring in the two weeks before the survey. The RBF programme did not appear to ameliorate wealth-related inequality regarding child low birth weight, neonatal mortality, stunting, diarrhoea prevalence, treatment for diarrhoea, and fever prevalence. A sensitivity check of the estimates indicates that our results are weakly robust to considering absolute inequality measures (slope index of inequality and the generalized Gini index). From a policy perspective, the results have important implications for public health policies geared towards improving access to maternal and child health care services in developing countries. Our analysis reveals that RBF programmes do not necessarily eliminate wealth-related inequality in maternal and child health outcomes in Zimbabwe but are certainly a valuable complement to equity-enhancing policies in the country.;Access to and Use of Services;Southern Africa;Working paper;African Economic Research Consortium;Sep-23;"Makate, Marshall

Finding the Time and Labor to Farm: How Social Dynamics Drive Gender Differences in Agricultural Labor in Southern Nigeria;Across Sub-Saharan Africa smallholder farmers depend heavily on manual labor supplied by their households, families, and communities, but women are particularly labor constrained. This research paired a detailed quantitative examination of patterns of gender difference in the allocation of time and agricultural labor with an in-depth qualitative examination of how people explain those patterns. The descriptive findings and resulting conceptual framework can be used to guide future programming and research. In southwestern Nigeria, married womenŐs time and agricultural labor constraints are rooted in common social expectations that menŐs farm plots take priority and that a womanŐs own farming should not interfere with the agricultural production managed by her husband. Women access lower quantity and quality of labor because of off-farm commitments, and time constraints around when in the day and when in the season labor is allocated to their farm plots. Overcoming agricultural labor constraints for women farmers, especially married women, may require reimagining the role of women and menŐs farms in the household. Several new Africa gender innovation lab studies suggest avenues for future innovations to support women producers.;Other;West Africa;Technical note;The World Bank;Mar-23;"Friedson-Ridenour, Sophia

Gender and Agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa: Review of Constraints and Effective Interventions;Raising agricultural is essential to boosting gross domestic product (GDP), reducing poverty, improving food security, and achieving structural transformation across Africa. Yet, AfricaŐs agricultural intensification has not kept pace with that of other developing regions. One significant and costly inefficiency undermining the regionŐs progress is the pervasive gender gap in agricultural productivity. This gender gap represents not only a substantial impediment to growth in the agricultural sector but, moreover, a forgone opportunity to increase national income and reduce poverty at the regional level. To address the productivity gender gap and realize the potential of African agriculture, establishing a clear understanding of the gender specific constraints hindering the productivity of women farmers is crucial. This paper develops a conceptual framework for thinking about the gender gap in agricultural productivity, reviews evidence on the effectiveness of policies and interventions designed to address the constraints faced by women farmers and proposes a research agenda to move the policy debate forward. Section II provides an overview of the agricultural gender gap in Sub-Saharan Africa. Section III presents a framework that establishes linkages between the choices that women farmers make, the constraints and contextual factors influencing their decisions, and the agricultural outcomes they achieve. Section IV identifies the constraints that women farmers face, reviews the evidence on the levels of severity and relative impact of these constraints on productivity, and highlights existing approaches and interventions that tackle these constraints. Section V outlines a research agenda to fill knowledge gaps and generate evidence useful to policymakers in Sub-Saharan Africa and beyond.

Women in Business-Prospects of SMEs in Gambia;Purpose: This article seeks to depict critical prospects that lieu most Gambia women especially those from the major business regions into SMEŐs and opportunities they can explore. Women empowerment and involvement in economic and social activities are very crucial to the development of the Gambian economy. Design/Methodology/Approach: A qualitative research approach is used in the study to further gather responses from selected women participants using a semi-structured interview. This approach has enabled participants to share all those desiring factors behind their venture establishment, and the opportunities available. The primary research population, sampling, and interview. Regarding the topic, data from secondary source and literatures from other journal was also used for comparison and analysis. Findings: The study made by the authors shows that, women from major administrative towns are very keen on engaging into meaningful endeavors such as small and medium-term enterprises at a youthful age mainly for economic gains and to contribute to the societies and countryŐs development. Originality/Value: There isnŐt much opportunity for Gambian women into micro and medium-term businesses, particularly from the side of government. And despite all constraints, the sector remains vibrant economic and social contributor in the advancement of this developing country. The issues that concentrate on women entrepreneurship in Africa in general is still a novelty since the originality and the value of the paper is considered to be high.;Ownership and Use of Economic Assets, Access to Jobs;West Africa;Article;ĘEuropean Research Studies Journal;Jul-23;Jim Secka & Joanna Wisniewska & Katarzyna Szopik-Depczynska;https://ideas.repec.org/a/ers/journl/vxxviy2023i1p121-131.html;Entrepreneurship, Productivity, Access to Capital & Productive Inputs;
Save women entrepreneurs: gender, cultural context, and micro-commerce performance in Togo;This study analyses gender differences in micro-commerce performance in Togo. Once a haven primarily occupied by women, the micro-commerce industry is now flooded with men. Because women are already underrepresented in other sectors of the economy, the influx of men into micro-commerce may gradually exclude women from economic activities, particularly if men outperform women in this industry. Using a sample of 13,488 micro-commerce businesses from the latest General Census of Enterprises (RGE, 2017Đ2018), we find that female-led micro-commerce businesses underperform compared to male-led micro-commerce businesses in Togo, but women perform better as employees. This result is obtained from an instrumental variables (IV) estimation strategy and is robust to supplementary tests, including adding more controls, implementing falsification tests, and using impact evaluation estimation methods. A deeper examination of this relationship illustrates that the gender bias in micro-commerce performance in Togo is mainly observed among regions with low education rates, low employment rates for women, a prevalence of polygamous unions, and a high rate of violence against women. Cultural context, therefore, influences the gender gap in micro-commerce performance in Togo.;Ownership and Use of Economic Assets, Other;West Africa;Article;Small Business Economics;Jul-23;Tchapo Gbandi, Ayira Korem & Kossiwa Zinsou-KlassouĘ;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11187-023-00798-8;Leadership & Management, Norms, Productivity, Entrepreneurship;

Gender and agricultural Productivity: Econometric evidence from Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda;Agricultural productivity gaps between men and women have been widely documented in many sub-Saharan African countries. Fundamentally, though, we contend that women have the same inherent intellectual (and thus farm management) capabilities as men but are inhibited by local conditions that put them at a disadvantage. We, therefore, hypothesize that by controlling for observed socio-economic, geographic, and agro-ecological characteristics, gender related farm productivity gaps would fade. Drawing on the Living Standards Measurement StudyĐIntegrated Surveys on Agriculture for Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda, we first match on observables to select comparable plots managed by male and female farmers, then estimate correlated true random effects stochastic production frontiers, followed by a meta-frontier to examine total factor productivity (TFP) and benchmarked technical efficiency. At the core of our approach is controlling for systematic observed and unobserved heterogeneity that could bias the comparative analysis. Results are mixed, but they tend to support our hypothesis. In Malawi, where we find market imperfections favor female farmers, women are more efficient than are male farmers and they exhibit TFP performance parity. In contrast, Tanzanian and Ugandan labor market imperfections favor male farmers, as do efficiency and TFP performance estimates.;Other;East Africa;Article;World Development;Nov-23;Jacques C.

Negotiating Gender Roles and Power Relations Through the Management of International Migrant Remittances in a Patriarchal Community in Ghana;"This paper draws on a feminist poststructural perspective to examine gendered dimensions of sending and managing international migrant remittances in a patriarchal community in Ghana.

It relies on primary data collected through in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and observation in Nkoranza, a Ghanaian community with a long history of international migration and receipt of remittances, to analyze the fluidity of gendered and intergenerational power relationships associated with managing remittances.

The findings show that males and females perform different roles as remitters and managers of remittances. While the patterns of sending and receiving remittances tend to conform to gender norms, which construct men as providers and women as carers, these subject positions are fluid. Although men are generally reluctant to perform traditional female roles even when their wives migrate, gendered and intergenerational power relations are being negotiated through the sending and management of remittances.";Ownership and Use of Economic Assets, Other;West Africa;Article;Journal of Asian and African Studies;Mar-23;"Teye, J.

Steered Away from the Fields: Short-Term Impacts of Oxen on Agricultural Production and Intra-household Labor Supply;Mechanization has the potential to boost agricultural production and reduce poverty in rural economies, but its impacts remain poorly understood. This paper randomizes the subsidized provision of a pair of traction oxen among 2,546 farmers in C™te dŐIvoire through a matching grant. The analysis finds positive impacts on householdsŐ agricultural production during the agricultural season overlapping with oxen delivery, and additional increases in total land holdings and use of complementary inputs in the subsequent season. The intervention affected household members in different ways, with wives and daughters substantially reducing their work on the farmŃespecially in districts with more stringent gender norms around handling oxen. In these districts, introducing traction oxen resulted in women shifting to off-farm work. The intervention also improved girlsŐ health and reduced school dropout among boys. The results provide novel evidence on the human development effects of mechanization, while highlighting how social prescriptions mediate the impacts of technology within the household.;Human Capital, Other;West Africa;Working paper;The World Bank;Jul-23;"Brudevold-Newman, Andrew

Maternal Work and ChildrenŐs Development: Examining 20 Years of Evidence;Maternal work may affect children positively through increased household income, higher control of mothers over available income, and expansion of maternal information networks through work contacts and greater decision-making power of mothers as they become more economically empowered. However, maternal work may reduce maternal time spent with children. If maternal time is not substituted for time of equal quality by other caregivers, childrenŐs development may be penalized. Stress associated with work may also decrease the quality of parenting. This review summarizes causal evidence on the relationship between maternal work and childrenŐs development.

Gendered Impacts of Climate Change: Evidence from Weather Shocks;Climate change is one of the defining challenges of our time. While the impacts of climate change on peopleŐs well-being can hardly be denied, it may not be as obvious that the impacts could differ by gender. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, a shock can impact men and women differently due to social norms and pre-existing gender differences. This paper reviews the economic literature linking weather shocks (such as floods, droughts, and extreme temperatures, among others) and a large range of outcomes (from endowments to economic opportunities and agency). Men and women indeed have specific vulnerabilities and exposures. Specific physiological vulnerabilities are relatively minor: boys are more vulnerable to shocks in utero and girls and women to heat. The biggest gendered impacts are due to existing gaps and social responses to shocks. In places with strong boy preferences, families facing scarcity due to disasters are more likely to give food and other resources to boys, take their daughters out of school or marry them young, or withdraw women from agricultural work so they focus on household chores. During or after weather shocks, boys can also be taken out of schools to be put at work and men working in agriculture are often forced to migrate to find alternative sources of income. Unless climate policy acknowledges and accounts for these differences, climate change will remain an amplifier of existing gender inequalities.;Other;Global;Working paper;The World Bank;May-23;"Fruttero, Anna

An Operational Approach to Enhancing WomenŐs and GirlsŐ Empowerment in World Bank Projects;"Gender equality has long been central to the World BankŐs twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. More recently, womenŐs and girlsŐ empowerment (WGE) has become a priority in the Africa region in the context of the regionŐs demographic transition.

Financial Inclusion: Lessons from World Bank Group Experience, Fiscal Years 2014Đ22;This evaluation explores how and with what effect the World Bank Group has supported financial inclusion for the microenterprises, poor households, women, and other excluded groups. Financial inclusion is defined as the use of financial services by individuals and firms. It encompasses financial accessŃowning an accountŃand the use of financial services. There has been an impressive growth in account ownership globally, from 55% of adults in 2014 to 71% in 2021, although usage is more limited as some accounts are inactive. Critically, both financial access and the use of financial services remain major challenges for microenterprises, poor households, women, and other excluded groups. The objective of the evaluation is to assess whether the Bank Group has been doing the right things and whether it has been doing things right on financial inclusion. The evaluation captures lessons from the World BankŐs experience supporting financial inclusion for microenterprises, poor households, women, and other excluded groups and updates a 2015 financial inclusion evaluation. The evaluation includes a retrospective look at the drive for universal financial access and examines progress and challenges in womenŐs access to financial services. The evaluation also assesses the Bank GroupŐs support for digital financial services as vehicles for financial inclusion. Finally, the report examines the World BankŐs response to COVID-19 as it relates to financial inclusion. The evaluation proposes three recommendations: (i) The World Bank and IFC should further encourage account use by underserved groups, including women and rural poor people, and emphasize this more in their strategies and projects. (ii) The World Bank and IFC should design and implement more comprehensive approaches that address constraints in the enabling environment for DFS to reach underserved and excluded groups. (iii) To enhance learning on what works to increase the beneficial use of financial services at the MPWEG, the World Bank and IFC should collect outcome data across different underserved and excluded groups, initially on a pilot basis.;Access to and Use of Services;Global;Impact evaluation;The World Bank;Aug-23;Independent Evaluation Group;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/40282;Financial Services & Inclusion, Digital Technologies & Services;
Financing Programs for Women's Financial Inclusion and Access to Finance for Women MSMEs: Results from a Survey of Public Development Banks;This report presents the highlights from a survey directed to public development banks (PDBs) as part of the 2023 agenda of the Finance in Common Summit (FiCS) Coalition on Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment in Development Banks, co-chaired by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and UN Women. The survey, which was completed by 54 PDBs, aimed to examine how PDBs are serving women and their businesses by mapping existing programs and identifying current practices, innovations, challenges, and opportunities in this agenda. Key findings suggest PDBs are offering a diversity of programs, product types, and innovative approaches, with varied institutional capabilities that range from the development stage to well-established systems that support productive financing, business development, green financing, and financial education and literacy in women micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises.

From natural risk to social justice: The influence of natural threats on gender inequality;Climate change and global warming are major modern challenges, while gender inequality has been a social issue throughout the history of humankind. This study attempts to investigate how natural threats influence gender inequality. The study estimates the influence of the likelihood of suffering harms due to natural hazards on gender inequality in education, health, employment, and rights for a sample of 130 countries from 2011 to 2019. Natural threats appear to reduce the proportions of waged and salaried female workers in comparison with males, while inducing higher levels of self-employment among women. Natural threats increase gender inequality in education at both primary and tertiary levels. Natural threats seem to decrease the health status of men more than that of women, which is reflected in increased ratios of female/male life expectancy or survival to age 65. Natural threats are, surprisingly, found to improve womenŐs rights.;Other, Access to Jobs, Human Capital;Global;Article;Environmental and Sustainability Indicators;Sep-23;Canh Phuc Nguyen, Binh Quang Nguyen;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indic.2023.100270;Climate & Environment, Education, Employment Access & Opportunities, External Shocks, Health;
WomenŐs Empowerment and Child Nutritional Outcomes in Rural Burkina Faso;Across developing countries, women play an important role both as producers of major food crops and in improving household nutrition. This research paper aims to assess the effect of improving women's empowerment on the nutritional status of children in rural Burkina Faso. Based on data from the 2014 Multisectoral Continuous Survey, the paper uses variables such as income control, access to land, autonomy in production decisions, access to credit, and social group membership to compute a composite index of womenŐs empowerment. Accounting for potential endogeneity of empowerment, the study adopts a dual-estimation approach that, first, uses average empowerment by stratum and, second, applies an instrumental variable. The results show a low baseline level of womenŐs empowerment in rural areas, but an improvement in empowerment has a relatively high and positive correlation with childrenŐs nutritional outcomes. The study suggests that improving womenŐs empowerment components will translate into significant gains in childrenŐs nutritional outcomes in rural households.;Human Capital;West Africa;Working paper;The World Bank;Sep-23;"Nikiema, PouirkŹta Rita

Gender-Segmented Labor Markets and Trade Shocks;Gender segmentation in labor markets shapes the local effects of international trade. This paper develops a theory that embeds trade in gender-segmented labor markets and shows that in this framework, foreign demand shocks may increase or decrease the female-to-male employment ratio. If a foreign demand shock from a relevant market happens in a female-intensive (male-intensive) sector, the model predicts that the female-to-male employment ratio should increase (decrease). The paper then uses plausibly exogenous variation in the exposure of Tunisian local labor markets to foreign demand shocks and shows that the empirical results are consistent with the theoretical prediction. In Tunisia, a country with a high degree of gender segmentation in the labor markets, foreign demand shocks have been relatively larger in male-intensive sectors. This induced a decrease in the female-to-male employment ratio, with households likely substituting female for male labor supply.;Access to Jobs;North Africa;Working paper;The World Bank;Jul-23;"Lopez-Acevedo, Gladys

Filling the Gaps: Childcare Laws for Women's Economic Empowerment;This paper aims to provide global evidence on whether and what attributes of laws governing the provision of childcare services affect women's labor market outcomes. It merges country-year-level data from the World Bank's Women, Business and the Law database, which documents childcare laws across countries, with data on women's labor force participation from ILOSTAT. Using a difference-in-difference estimation framework, the analysis finds that the enactment of childcare laws increases women's labor force participation by 2 percent, on average. Moreover, the effect increases over time, reaching up to 4 percent five years after an enactment. This effect is driven by women who are married, have completed less than primary education, and are between the ages of 35 and 44. Lastly, regulation of the availability and affordability of childcare has a similar impact on female labor force participation, whereas the effect of quality regulation is smaller.;Human Capital, Access to and Use of Services;Global;Working paper;The World Bank;Jul-23;"Anukriti, S.

Why Do People Move across State Borders?: Evidence from Mexico;This study uses the 2020 Census to explore the determinants of interstate migration in Mexico between 2015 and 2020 and the earnings gains from migration. The study analyzes both spatial characteristics (push and pull factors in the origin and destination states) and individual factors that influence the decision to migrate and where to migrate. Push and pull factors are assessed using a gravity-type model. Individual factors are analyzed using a multinomial regression model that accounts for migration reasons. Subsequently, the study measures the impact of internal migration on labor income. Earnings gains are estimated using a double selection model that accounts simultaneously for the decisions to migrate and to work. Finally, the paper discusses some policy recommendations that could help leverage internal migration potential for improving women's labor market outcomes.;Other, Access to Jobs;Latin America;Working paper;The World Bank;Jul-23;"Saavedra, Trinidad

How Do Agricultural Import Tariffs Affect Men and Women Smallholders?: Evidence from Bangladesh;"Using newly available customs data from Bangladesh, along with additional administrative and survey data, this study examines how variation in import tariffs on key agricultural inputs affects menŐs and womenŐs agricultural employment and productionŃgiven a high degree of segmentation among men and women in different agricultural activities. In Bangladesh, women and men in agriculture are typically smallholders and maintain distinct occupations within the sector (women in livestock and poultry rearing, and men in crop agriculture). These areas are both heavily dependent on imported commodities (grains and oilseed for livestock and poultry feed, as well as seeds and fertilizer for crop agriculture). The paper shows that import tariff rates are much higher on feed-related inputs; imported inputs for crop agriculture, such as fertilizer, are also heavily subsidized. The paper also shows that the higher resulting prices for inputs used in feed are significantly negatively associated with employment and earnings in poultry and livestock activity, where women are heavily concentrated. Among those marketing output, earnings also tend to be substantially higher in crop agriculture than in livestock/poultry activity, underscoring the need for closely examining how import tariffs can affect more vulnerable groups. Individual producers are also heavily reliant on livestock for own-consumption activity, reducing their ability to pass on increased input costs.";Access to Jobs, Other, Ownership and Use of Economic Assets;South Asia;Working paper;The World Bank;Jun-23;"Koolwal, Gayatri

Returns to Education in the Marriage Market: Bride Price and School Reform in Egypt;This paper posits marriage market returns as a contributing factor to stagnant female labor force participation despite increasing female education. The paper examines the marriage market returns of female education by exploiting a very direct measure of returns: bride price, a significant amount of resources transferred by the groom at the time of marriage. The paper also looks at current and future husband's wages as additional sources of returns. It addresses endogeneity and identification issues by exploiting a school reform in Egypt that reduced the number of years required to complete primary education from six to five. The staggered rollout of the reform generates exogenous sources of variation in female schooling both across and within cohorts and administrative units. The analysis implements an instrumental variable estimator with fixed effects at the cohort and at the administrative unit level. The estimated return to a bride's compulsory education is about 100% for bride price, about 14% for husband's wage at the time of marriage, and about 16% for a measure of husband's permanent income. Importantly, these returns to education in the marriage market are much higher than the returns to education that Egyptian women experience in the labor market. Additional empirical evidence suggests that educational assortative mating could be an important mechanism through which the marriage market returns are taking place.;Access to Jobs, Human Capital;MNA, Middle East;Working paper;The World Bank;May-23;"Deng, Jingyuan

Liberian Women Count: Evidence from a Macrosimulation of the Gender Dividend;Liberian women make significant economic contributions yet are constrained from contributing even more due to their exclusion from productive opportunities. This study develops a macrosimulation model of the Gender Dividend that estimates the economic contributions of women and the societal costs incurred by excluding them. Using macroeconomic, demographic, and survey data from Liberia, the analysis finds that women were responsible for 39 percent of market-based output produced annually in 2020, equal to US$1.08 billion, and contributed another US$530 million in non-tradable sources of production, namely, housework and domestic chores. Using the macrosimulation model, the study estimates that if the gender gaps in labor force participation, intra-sectoral wages, and sector of employment were closed, gross domestic product would be 11.5 percent higher. If further reforms were undertaken to equalize education and reduce fertility rates to a net-reproduction rate, gross domestic product would be 23.7 percent higher. Finally, if the model also accounts for the value of non-tradable production, gross domestic product would be US$5.89 billion, or 45.3 percent higher than todayŐs estimates, with women being responsible for 53 percent of the labor market output. These estimates reinforce the need for a unified policy agenda that actively invests in womenŐs human capital and work-related opportunities simultaneously.;Access to Jobs, Human Capital;West Africa;Working paper;The World Bank;May-23;"Karra, Mahesh

Drawing on survey data from 17,951 individuals in North-east Nigeria, the analysis finds that coping behaviors at the household, adult, and child levels are interlinked and strongly shaped by compounding challenges stemming from individual gender, household forced displacement status, and local violence shocks. These challenges have significant welfare implications and create severe vulnerabilities and special needs for specific groups of households and individuals, such as rural communities affected by violence, large households with many children, female breadwinners, and displaced girls. The findings emphasize the need for and potential of concerted policy approaches that account for the intersectionality of gender, displacement, and violence in conflict settings and pay particular attention to specific types of communities, households, and individuals.;Other;West Africa;Working paper;The World Bank;Mar-23;"Stojetz, Wolfgang

Leaning in at Home: Women's Promotions and Intra-household Bargaining in Bangladesh;It is established that entering employment improves a woman's bargaining position in the household. This paper investigates whether a woman's career advancement further improves her intra-household bargaining power. The analysis exploits quasi-random participation in a career promotion program in Bangladesh's garment industry to causally estimate the impact of women's promotion on household decision-making. The findings show that women who participate in the promotion program gain bargaining power as measured by higher expenditures on women (51%) and girls (74%), and on remittances (58%). The promotion-related income effect only partially explains these increases, suggesting that women gain more agency over household income more generally. Further, these new female managers now serve as role models to their staff. The paper finds that the direct effects spill over to women who are quasi-randomly exposed to the new female managers, who also report more say in household decisions. Complementarities between women's positions in the workplace and in the household appear important.;Leadership;South Asia;Working paper;The World Bank;Mar-23;Uckat, Hannah;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/39586;Employment Access & Opportunities, Leadership & Management, Economic Empowerment;

Family Change in Latin America: Schooling and Labor Market Implications for Children and Women;"This chapter provides an account of the major family transformations that occurred in recent decades across Latin American and Caribbean countries and examines the implications of such transformations for childrens school attendance and progress and womens labor force participation. Latin American and Caribbean families and households have undergone substantial changes in recent years while keeping some of their distinctive features unchanged (Esteve et al., 2022; Esteve & Florez-Paredes, 2018a; Ju‡rez & Gayet, 2014). This combination of stability and change has had profound transformations in the family status in which women raise their children and the family context in which children are raised. We refer to family context as the combination of womens marital status and the type of households in which children reside. We combine references to the literature and own calculations based on Latin American and Caribbean population census samples, available at the Integrated Public-use Microdata Series International (IPUMS) (Minnesota Population Center, 2020). We use data from 25 countries based on the most recent census microdata and, in some instances, historical samples starting in the late 1950s (see Appendix 1). 
The chapter is organized as follows. First, we document trends in family change and childrens status. To illustrate family change empirically, we focus on women aged 25 to 29 and children aged 7 to 16. For reasons that will be displayed during the paper, these groups offer a reliable overview of major transformations with the advantage of avoiding overlapping cohorts when data are analyzed over time. Variations by educational attainment are also examined to illustrate the role of inequality of opportunities in family change. Second, we focus on the implications of family forms on children's school attendance and progress and women's participation in the labor market. In the absence of tailored indicators about progress in cognitive and non-cognitive skills, school attendance and progress are standard indicators of early human capital accumulation (UNESCO, 2022). We examine these two outcomes among more than 15 million children included in the IPUMS-I census samples. For women, we examine the degree of participation in the labor market (n 16 million).";Human Capital, Access to Jobs;Latin America, Caribbean;Working paper;Inter-American Development Bank;Sep-23;"Esteve, Albert;  Castro, AndrŽs;  Becca, Federica";http://dx.doi.org/10.18235/0005145;Education, Employment Access & Opportunities, Productivity, Other, Youth;
Gender Gaps in Ownership of Nonagricultural Enterprises in Georgia, Mongolia, and the Philippines;"Using unique survey data from Georgia, Mongolia, and the Philippines, we examine gender gaps in entrepreneurship. The overall incidence of entrepreneurship is highest in Cavite, Philippines, while the gender gap in ownership is highest in Mongolia. On average, enterprises operated by men have larger firm size relative to those operated by women. Except for Mongolia, the average income of male-owned enterprises is greater than the average income of female-owned enterprises. Multivariate analysis suggests that the determinants of income vary by gender and across countries.
Using the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, we find the average difference in income between menŐs and womenŐs enterprise is not significant in Mongolia. More than 50% of the gender income gap is explained by observable characteristics in Georgia and the Philippines. On average, the income of female-owned enterprises would have seen a rise of 64% (Cavite, Philippines) and 59% (Georgia) if they had the same characteristics as male-owned firms.";Access to Jobs, Ownership and Use of Economic Assets;Asia;Working paper;Asia Development Bank;Oct-23;Swaminathan, Hema Martinez, Arturo Jr. Joshi, Kaushal Addawe, Mildred Soco, Christian Flora Mae Baes-Espineda, Remedios;http://dx.doi.org/10.22617/WPS230391-2;Gender Pay Gap, Entrepreneurship;

Monetary Policy and Labor Market Gender Gaps ;We study the effects of monetary policy shocks on employment gender gaps in a panel of 22 countries using quarterly data from 1990 to 2019. Our results show that menŐs employment falls more than womenŐs after contractionary monetary policy shocks, narrowing the employment gender gap over time. Two factors contribute to explaining this heterogeneous effect. First, a larger impact of monetary policy shocks on employment in the industry sector that employs more men. Second, the larger response of the employment gap in the sector (services) that employs the largest share of men and women. In terms of labor market adjustment, the narrowing of the gender employment gap is initially driven by a reduction in the gender unemployment gaps that, over time, results in an adjustment in the gender labor force participation gapŃwith menŐs labor force participation dropping more than womenŐs. The effects are larger in countries with more flexible labor market regulations, higher gender wage gaps, and lower informal womenŐs employment compared to menŐs. Finally, the effects are also larger for contractionary monetary policy shocks and during expansions.;Access to Jobs;Global;Working paper;International Monetary Fund;Sep-23;"Flamini, Valentina ; Gomes, B.

"Breaking the Cycle of Gender-based Violence
Translating Evidence into Action for Victim/Survivor-centred Governance";An alarming number of women and girls become victims/survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) at least once during their lifetime. While GBV has garnered more attention from policymakers in recent years, and has become a top gender-equality priority for OECD countries, significant challenges remain in all countries. This report promotes a comprehensive approach to breaking the cycle of GBV by combining insights from recent OECD work with robust evidence from surveys and questionnaires conducted in OECD Member countries. It offers recommendations for a comprehensive OECD GBV Governance Framework encompassing laws and access to justice, transforming restrictive gender norms, and integrating service delivery to prevent, address and - ultimately - end this violation of human rights.;Gender-Based Violence (GBV);OECD;Report;OECD;Oct-23;OECD;https://www.oecd.org/publications/breaking-the-cycle-of-gender-based-violence-b133e75c-en.htm;Gender-Based Violence (GBV), Legislation, Norms, Basic Services;
Breastfeeding and Infant Care as ÔSexedŐ Care Work: Reconsideration of the Three Rs to Enable WomenŐs Rights, Economic Empowerment, Nutrition and Health;"WomenŐs lifelong health and nutrition status is intricately related to their reproductive history, including the number and spacing of their pregnancies and births, and for how long and how intensively they breastfeed their children.

In turn, womenŐs reproductive biology is closely linked to their social roles and situation, including regarding economic disadvantage and disproportionate unpaid work. Recognizing, as well as reducing and redistributing womenŐs care and domestic work (known as the ÔThree RsŐ), is an established framework for addressing womenŐs inequitable unpaid care work. However, the care work of breastfeeding presents a dilemma, and is even a divisive issue, for advocates of womenŐs empowerment, because reducing breastfeeding and replacing it with commercial milk formula risks harming womenŐs and childrenŐs health.

It is therefore necessary for the interaction between womenŐs reproductive biology and infant care role to be recognized in order to support womenŐs human rights and enable governments to implement economic, employment and other policies to empower women. In this paper, we argue that breastfeedingĐlike childbirthĐis reproductive work that should not be reduced and cannot sensibly be directly redistributed to fathers or others. Rather, we contend that the Three Rs agenda should be reconceptualized to isolate breastfeeding as ÔsexedŐ care work that should be supported rather than reduced with action taken to avoid undermining breastfeeding.

This means that initiatives toward gender equality should be assessed against their impact on womenŐs ability to breastfeed. With this reconceptualization, adjustments are also needed to key global economic institutions and national statistical systems to appropriately recognize the value of this work.

Additional structural supports such as maternity protection and childcare are needed to ensure that childbearing and breastfeeding do not disadvantage women amidst efforts to reduce gender pay gaps and gender economic inequality. Distinct policy interventions are also required to facilitate fathersŐ engagement in enabling and supporting breastfeeding through sharing the other unpaid care work associated with parentsŐ time-consuming care responsibilities, for both infants and young children and related household work.";Human Capital;Global;Article;Institute for Development Studies;Oct-23;"Gribble, K.; Smith, J.P.; Gammeltoft, T.; Ulep, V.; Van Esterik, P.; Craig, L.; Pereira-Kotze, C.; Chopra, D.; Siregar, A.Y.M.; Hajizadeh, M. and Mathisen, R.";10.3389/fpubh.2023.1181229;Care, Other, Health, Children;
Understanding the Impacts of Paid Maternity Leave on Women's Labor Market Outcomes;All OECD countries except the United States offer at least four months of paid maternity leave, and the average duration of mandated paid maternity leave has increased steadily from 1970 to the present. There is some evidence that paid leave policies above a certain duration negatively impact women's labor market outcomes. In order to estimate the effects of paid leave, we link data on 40 years of paid leave policy across 24 European countries to survey data using a birth-cohort panel. Following previous work, we show that conventional fixed effects estimation suggests a non-monotonic relationship between leave length and women's labor force attachment, with leaves of three months or less increasing women's labor force attachment while longer leaves reduce it. However, in our context, the putative positive impacts of short-duration maternity leaves on women's employment appear to be driven by negative weighting in fixed effects estimation, which is explained by the fact that all countries in our sample eventually adopt short-duration leave policies. Using a robust imputation-based estimator, we find that maternity leaves longer than three months negatively affect female employment and increase women's domestic work burden. Leaves longer than six months also reduce women's educational attainment and their propensity to raise children.;Access to Jobs;OECD;Discussion paper;IZA;Oct-23;Lillian Bates, Oliver Hall, Pamela Jakiela;https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/16565/understanding-the-impacts-of-paid-maternity-leave-on-womens-labor-market-outcomes;Employment Access & Opportunities, Social Protection, Other;
Rainfall Variability and Labor Allocation in Uzbekistan: The Role of Women's Empowerment;Employing novel household survey data, this paper examines how rainfall variability and mean temperature affect individual labor supply in Uzbekistan, a highly traditional lower-middle-income country in Central Asia. The findings suggest that rainfall variability induces the reallocation of labor supply: (i) out of agriculture to unemployment, (ii) from unemployment to business activities and irregular remunerated activities, and (iii) from being out of labor force to unemployment. These effects differ in rural and urban areas and by gender. In addition, active women's involvement in the labor market and household decision-making mediates the impact of climate variability on employment choices, especially in rural areas. This implies that traditional gender roles may make households in developing countries more vulnerable to adverse consequences of climate change, while women's empowerment may smooth such consequences.;Access to Jobs;Central Asia;Discussion paper;IZA;Sep-23;Vladimir Otrachshenko, Olga Popova, Nargiza Alimukhamedova;https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/16421/rainfall-variability-and-labor-allocation-in-uzbekistan-the-role-of-womens-empowerment;Agriculture, Norms, Economic Empowerment, Productivity, Employment Access & Opportunities, Climate & Environment, Rural;
The Gender Pay Gap: Micro Sources and Macro Consequences;Using linked employer-employee data from Brazil, we document a large gender pay gap due to women working at lower-paying employers with better nonpay attributes. To interpret these facts, we develop an equilibrium search model with endogenous firm pay, amenities, and hiring. We provide a constructive proof of identification of all model parameters. The estimated model suggests that amenities are important for both men and women, that compensating differentials explain half of the gender pay gap, and that there are significant output and welfare gains from eliminating gender differences. However, equal-treatment policies fail to achieve those gains.;Other;Latin America;Discussion paper;IZA;Aug-23;Iacopo Morchio, Christian Moser;https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/16409/the-gender-pay-gap-micro-sources-and-macro-consequences;Gender Pay Gap, Private Sector;

When Women's Work Disappears: Marriage and Fertility Decisions in Peru;This paper studies the gendered labor market and demographic effects of trade liberalization in Peru. To identify these effects, we use variation in the exposure of local labor markets to import competition from China based on their baseline industrial composition. On average, the increase in Chinese imports during 1998-2008 led to a persistent decline in the employment share of low-educated female workers but had smaller and transitory effects on the employment of low-educated men. In contrast to the predictions of Becker's model of household specialization, we find that the increase in import competition during this period increased the share of single low-educated people and decreased their marriage rates. There is little evidence that import competition affected fertility decisions. The results highlight the role of gains from joint consumption in marriage formation.;Access to Jobs;East Asia;Discussion paper;IZA;Aug-23;Hani Mansour, Pamela Medina, Andrea Velasquez;https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/16364/when-womens-work-disappears-marriage-and-fertility-decisions-in-peru;Employment Access & Opportunities, Other;
The Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic Recession on Less Educated Women's Human Capital: Some Projections;The recession induced by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in major declines in employment of women, both from the demand side as firms reduced employment and from the supply side resulting from school closures and the closing of many child care facilities. We provide projections of possible impacts of this reduction on less-educated women's future human capital framed within the traditional Mincerian model that implies that wage growth falls if a recession reduces the growth of work experience. We develop a new and modified form of the Mincerian log wage equation which we argue captures the effect of women's work experience on their human capital in a way superior to the traditional form of that equation. Using that modified form, we estimate the impact of recession-induced loss of work experience on wages. Our model, estimated on pre-COVID data, incorporates special features anticipated to be of importance in the pandemic, including the degree to which negative aggregate shocks occur to pandemic-specific industries, whether the impact of shocks varies by telecommuting occupation, and how the impact varies with the presence of preschool and school-age children who are affected by school and child-care facility closures. We find that wage losses one year out from 2020 are relatively modest on average, generally less than one percent, with the largest for married women without children in the home. But losses are greater for married women at young ages, mothers with very young children, and for those working in COVID-impacted industries. School and child care closures increase projected negative wage impacts for married mothers by an additional 50 percent.;Human Capital;North America;Discussion paper;IZA;Jun-23;Mark Drozd, Robert A.

Husbands' Wages and Married Women's Labor Supply in Urban China;This study examines the impact of husbands' wages on their wives' labor force participation rates and hours worked in urban China from 1995 to 2018. We find that an increase in husbands' wages reduces the labor force participation rate of married women with similar education levels. Controlling for gender identityŃin particular, an aversion to the wife earning more than her husbandŃstrengthens the income effect of husbands' wages. The labor supply effect of husbands' wages is more significant for younger and less-educated women and those with more children.

Thriving in the Rain: Natural Shocks, Time Allocation, and Women's Empowerment in Bangladesh;In low- and middle-income countries, differences between men and women in their time use patterns represent a major source of gender inequality. Among other factors, natural shocks can contribute to the widening of these differences. This paper examines the impact of the 2017 flood in Bangladesh on men's and women's time use patterns and women's empowerment. Using georeferenced and longitudinal data, we find that the flood decreased women's time spent on domestic work while increasing their engagement in paid activities and empowerment. In contrast, men spent less time at work and increased their participation in housework to substitute for women's domestic work. These responses to the shock are confirmed only for those individuals who were exposed to another flooding event that occurred in 2014. To better understand the underlying mechanisms, we look at the medium-term impact of the 2014 flood on women's empowerment and on their engagement in paid activities, and we find that the shock still positively affects both variables, suggesting that when endogenous, an increase in empowerment persists over time and influences reactions to the 2017 shock.;Other;South Asia;Discussion paper;IZA;Mar-23;Sveva Vitellozzi, Gianna Claudia Giannelli;https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/16030/thriving-in-the-rain-natural-shocks-time-allocation-and-womens-empowerment-in-bangladesh;Employment Access & Opportunities, External Shocks, Climate & Environment, Economic Empowerment, Care;
Social Norms and Female Labor Force Participation in Bangladesh: The Role of Social Expectations and Reference Networks;About 50% of Bangladesh's female youth working-age population is not in employment, education, or training (NEET). Reducing this number is an important policy goal. However, there is a broad consensus that pervasive gender norms hamper this goal in Bangladesh and other countries from the Global South. In this study, we analyze the social basis of support for young working women. It departs from a theoretical understanding of norms as conditional upon expectations in one's reference network. Based on vignette experiments, we show that manipulating expectations about acceptance of female employment by others influences personal support for women taking up work. Moreover, we address the question of whose views matter. Manipulating the expectation that fathers (or husbands in the case of married NEETs) support the employment of their daughters (wives) has a particularly strong effect on respondents' support. In contrast, the stance of religious authorities and peers has surprisingly little relevance. Our evidence suggests that (expectations about) traditional views of fathers and husbands regarding the role of females are a key obstacle to a higher labor force participation of young women in Bangladesh.;Access to Jobs, Other;South Asia;Discussion paper;IZA;Mar-23;Luna Bellani, Kumar Biswas, Sebastian Fehrler, Paul Marx, Shwetlena Sabarwal, Syed Rashed Al-Zayed Josh;https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/16006/social-norms-and-female-labor-force-participation-in-bangladesh-the-role-of-social-expectations-and-reference-networks;Norms, Employment Access & Opportunities;

Unlanded Class: Albania's Gender Gaps in Land Ownership and Inheritance;"This study investigates gender gaps in access to land ownership and land inheritance in Albanian rural areas by combining a large-scale survey and five in-depth focus groups discussions. The article considers three sets of variables: place-based characteristics; family characteristics; and individual characteristics. Results find that rural societies lack awareness around legal property rights, undermine the confidence of women in myriad ways, and continue to rely on customary laws. Current inequalities are placed in the context of Albania's entrenched patriarchal system. Culture and tradition are as important as, if not more important than, legal frameworks surrounding land ownership and inheritance. The findings bring intersectionality issues into high relief: where patriarchy is combined with poverty, gender inequality is exacerbated. Findings call for a more holistic approach that combines efforts to improve legal literacy, raise awareness among all genders, and alleviate poverty for boosting women's inclusion in the economy.HIGHLIGHTS In Albania, patriarchal customary laws disfavor women when it comes to property ownership, inheritance, and decision making.Women in rural societies, in particular, rely on custom and have low awareness of their legal property rights.Women who are more informed about formal laws view themselves as more equal to men.Where patriarchy is combined with poverty, gender inequality is exacerbated.Education and legal literacy are key to overcoming entrenched patriarchy and fostering womenŐs empowerment.";Ownership and Use of Economic Assets;Eastern Europe;Article;IDEAS;Apr-23;"Edvin Zhllima

Going beyond female-headed households: Household composition and gender differences in poverty;"This study sharpens comparisons of gender differences in poverty in South Africa by distinguishing households according to the gender composition of resident adults rather than by household headship. The categories of female-dominated and male-dominated households (where all adults are either women or men respectively) are subsets of female- and male-headed households but their classification avoids many of the problems associated with the concept of household headship. Using nationally representative micro-data, we show that both female-dominated and male-dominated households have become more prevalent over time. Comparing these household types reveals that when men live without women, they mostly live alone; while women who live without men are far more likely to live with children. These differences in household composition help to explain why the gender poverty differential is more marked when comparing female- and male-dominated households as opposed to the broader and more heterogeneous categories of female- and male-headed households.";Other;Southern Africa;Article;IDEAS;Sep-23;"Dorrit Posel

Job Guarantee as Tool for Women's Empowerment: Propensity Score Matching Analysis;WomenŐs empowerment relies on access to resources routed through micro-credit, cash transfers, self-employment, or wage-based employment. Educational qualifications such as formal education or vocational training provide the routes for employment. However, the Indian job guarantee program Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) ensures a minimum of 100 days of job guarantee to anyone willing to work without any eligibility criteria related to formal education. While gendered provisions in the program are intended to encourage womenŐs participation to make them self-reliant, the safety net features also protect their dignity. Therefore, aspects related to women's empowerment, such as their more significant say in household decision-making, may likely be impacted by the program. In addition, the program provides institutional support to women and access to resources through the wages earned. Analysis based on the robust propensity score matching analysis suggests that the women have been empowered from the point of view of household decision making. A similar analysis also holds for the women from the vulnerable sections of society. Hence, although intended for poverty alleviation, the programme acts as a tool for empowering rural women in India.;Ownership and Use of Economic Assets, Leadership;South Asia;Article;IDEAS;Feb-23;"Ashutosh Kumar

A Qualitative Study to Explore the Socioeconomic Status of Women Working in Livestock Production;"Purpose: Rural women comprise of one quarter of the total world population, and they are considered key agents for achieving the transformational economic, environmental and social changes required for sustainable development. The purpose of this study is to assess the socioeconomic status of women working in livestock activities and to find out the impact of this work on their lives. 
Design/Methodology/Approach: Data was collected from three different villages of District Rahim Yar Khan Punjab Province, Pakistan. In-depth interviews were conducted from a selected group of ten rural women, which were further divided into two groups based on age.Findings: The thematic analysis revealed the deprived socioeconomic status and vulnerabilities reported by women working in this sector in rural areas. Although financial benefits are reported as a positive impact, health risks, work and gender related issues surfaced the negative impact of this work on their lives.

More Rights but Less Gains: Relaxed Birth Control Policy and the Loss for Women;In view of its aging population, China initiated in 2012 a relaxed birth control policy after a three_decades_long implementation of the restrictive one_child policy. This paper examines how China's relaxed birth control policy leads to gender inequality. It specifically focuses on migrant workers because they account for a significant portion of the working group. Using the National Migrant Population Dynamic Monitoring Survey from 2014 to 2016, we found that China's two_child pilot policy reduced female labor force participation by 1.4 percentage points. This negative effect was more pronounced for women with higher educational levels or working in the private sector because employers foresee greater risks of productivity decline. We demonstrated that the gender pay gap increased from RMB956 to RMB1,053 during this same period. Pinpointing these unintended consequences brought about by the relaxation of the one_child policy helps provide a more complete picture of inequality and make sense of persistent relative poverty in Chinese society. To counteract gender discrimination, females are advised to work outside their home jurisdictions and take advantage of positive peer effects.;Human Capital, Other;East Asia;Article;IDEAS;Mar-23;"Ying Zhao

Does Gender Equality in Labor Participation Bring Real Equality? Evidence from Developed and Developing Countries;Drawing on various macro- and micro-data sources, the authors present robust evidence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between female labor force participation and inequality. Overall, female labor force participation is found to have a strong and significant dis-equalizing impact in at least three groups of developing countries with relatively low initial levels of participation. A decile-level analysis shows that female labor force participation has higher levels of returns among top deciles compared with the lower deciles in the developing countries analyzed. This evidence focuses attention on the importance of developing policies specifically targeting women in lower deciles of the income distribution.;Access to Jobs;Global;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-21;"Alfani, Federica;ĘClementi, Fabio;ĘFabiani, Michele;ĘMolini,ĘVasco; Valentini, Enzo";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/35518;Poverty, Employment Access & Opportunities;

The Power and Roots of Aspirations : A Survey of the Empirical Evidence;Aspirations have become a common theme in empirical economics studies, but there is no unified understanding of the range of outcomes they influence, the factors that shape them, and how to measure them. This paper surveys this growing literature. The paper argues that there is compelling evidence to consider aspirations as a useful lens to analyze human behavior and development outcomes, at the individual and aggregate levels, in poorer and richer countries. The empirical evidence aligns with the theory that high aspirations can lead individuals to achieve better educational, labor market, and other outcomes and can contribute to making countries more equal and prosperous. The empirical evidence also confirms that the mix of social and circumstantial factors shaping aspirations tends to hinder the aspirations of the disadvantagedŃsuch as the poor, immigrants, and womenŃand can contribute to vicious circles of poverty, high inequality, low social mobility, and low growth. However, high aspirations should not be considered as an end in themselves as they can backfire, with deleterious effects, if unmatched with opportunities. Further, the paper argues that definitional and measurement issues can affect the understanding of the topic and that studies should more explicitly describe their measures of aspirations to ensure that divergent underlying concepts are not mistaken.;Other;Global;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-21;"Fruttero, Anna; Muller, Noel; Calvo-Gonzalez, Oscar";http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/332481625231659043/The-Power-and-Roots-of-Aspirations-A-Survey-of-the-Empirical-Evidence;Poverty, Other, Norms;

Breaking Barriers: Female Entrepreneurs Who Cross Over to Male-Dominated Sectors;The report focuses on sectoral choice as one of the contributors to the gender gap in firm performance. It explores the difference in profits among female entrepreneurs who cross over into male-dominated sectors (MDS) compared to those who remain in traditionally female-concentrated sectors (FCS). The report provides a snapshot of the factors associated with being a female entrepreneur who crosses over to MDS, including the most salient cross-country ones that are associated with breaking into and surviving in these sectors. Based on this analysis, it offers evidence-based programs and policies which can support women to cross over into more profitable sectors and contribute to their business performance more generally.

Preventing More 'Missing Girls': A Review of Policies to Tackle Son Preference;In parts of Asia, South Caucasus, and the Balkans, son preference is strong enough to trigger significant levels of sex selection, result in the excess mortality of girls, and skew child sex ratios in favor of boys. Every year, 1.8 million girls under the age of five go ŇmissingÓ because of the widespread use of sex selective practices in these regions. The pervasive use of such practices is reflective of the striking inequities girls face today, and it also has negative implications for efforts to improve women's status in the long term. Consequently, governments of countries in these regions have employed direct measures, such as banning the use of prenatal sex selection technology and providing financial incentives to families that have girls. This paper takes stock of the direct measures used across countries grappling with skewed child sex ratios and compares the efficacy of direct measures with measures that indirectly raise the value of daughters. The stocktaking suggests that there is no conclusive evidence that direct approaches reduce the higher mortality risk for girls. Bans on the use of sex selection technology may inadvertently worsen the status of the very individuals they intend to protect, and financial incentives to families with girls offer short-term benefits at most. Alternatively, indirect measures, such as legal reform to promote gender equity and advocacy efforts, offer more promise by bringing about permanent shifts in the relative value of daughters. The stocktaking also underscores the paucity of causal studies in this literature.;Other;Global;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-18;"Kumar, Sneha; Sinha, Nistha";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/30656;Norms, Discrimination;
On norms and agency: conversations about gender equality with women and men in 20 countries;This report provides tremendous insight on gender norms an area that has been resistant to change, and that constrains achievement of gender equality across many diverse cultures. The report synthesizes data collected from more than 4,000 women and men in 97 communities across 20 countries. It is the largest dataset ever collected on the topic of gender and development, providing an unprecedented opportunity to examine potential patterns across communities on social norms and gender roles, pathways of empowerment, and factors that drive acute inequalities. The analysis raises the profile of persistent social norms and their impact on agency, and catalyzes discourse on the many pathways that create opportunities for women and men to negotiate transformative change. The report is underpinned by the fact that arguably the single most important contribution to development is to unleash the full power of half the people on the planet women. It underscores how crucial making investments in learning, supporting innovations that reduce the time costs of womenŐs mobility, and developing a critical mass of women and men pushing the boundaries of entrenched social norms are in enhancing womenŐs agency and capacity to aspire.;Other;Global;Report;World Bank Group;Jan-13;"MunozĘBoudet, AnaĘMaria;ĘPetesch, PattiĘL.;ĘTurk, Carolyn";https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/429741468343732476/pdf/On-norms-and-agency-conversations-about-gender-equality-with-women-and-men-in-20-countries.pdf;Norms, Discrimination;
Gender Differences in Poverty and Household Composition through the Life-Cycle: A Global Perspective;This paper uses household surveys from 89 countries to look at gender differences in poverty in the developing world. In the absence of individual-level poverty data, the paper looks at what can we learn in terms of gender differences by looking at the available individual and household level information. The estimates are based on the same surveys and welfare measures as official World Bank poverty estimates. The paper focuses on the relationship between age, sex and poverty. And finds that, girls and women of reproductive age are more likely to live in poor households (below the international poverty line) than boys and men. It finds that 122 women between the ages of 25 and 34 live in poor households for every 100 men of the same age group. The analysis also examines the household profiles of the poor, seeking to go beyond headship definitions. Using a demographic household composition shows that nuclear family households of two married adults and children account for 41 percent of poor households, and are the most frequent household where poor women are found. Using an economic household composition classification, households with a male earner, children and a non-income earner spouse are the most frequent among the poor at 36 percent, and the more frequent household where poor women live. For individuals, as well as for households, the presence of children increases the household likelihood to be poor, and this has a specific impact on women, but does not fully explain the observed female poverty penalty.;Other;Global;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-18;"MunozĘBoudet, AnaĘMaria; Buitrago, Paola; De LaĘBriere,ĘBenedicteĘLeroy;ĘNewhouse, David; RubianoĘMatulevich, Eliana; Scott,ĘKinnon; Suarez-Becerra, Pablo";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/29426;Poverty;
A Global View of Poverty, Gender, and Household Composition;The share of the worldŐs population living on less than $1.90 a day has been cut by more than half since 2000. The pace of progress has slowed in recent years, however, and is likely to regress with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Advancements toward achieving the goal of reducing poverty can be informed by more in-depth examination of the prevailing poverty profile across countries. This paper uses data from 91 countries to profile the poor through a focus on the demographic composition of households. It contributes to a growing body of literature on the profile of the poor based on household demographics, utilizing harmonized cross-country data. Three key findings related to household demographics and the profile of the poor emerge. First, globally, the share of young girls who reside in poor households is almost 1 percentage point larger than the corresponding share of boys, principally driven by results from India. In most other countries, girls and boys (who generally reside with adults) are equally likely to reside in poor households. Second, along the life cycle, the next big difference in poverty rates by sex globally sits among household members ages 25-34, with South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa driving these results. Third, analysis demonstrates that differences in household composition between women and men, including womenŐs greater likelihood to be living in households with young children, are behind the observed gap in poverty rates by sex.;Other;Global;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-21;"Munoz Boudet, Ana Maria; Bhatt, Antra; Azcona, Ginette;ĘYoo, Jayne; Beegle, Kathleen";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/35183;Poverty;
A Multi-Country Analysis of Multidimensional Poverty in Contexts of Forced Displacement;Despite the many simultaneous deprivations faced by forcibly displaced communities, such as food insecurity, inadequate housing, or lack of access to education, there is little research on the level and composition of multidimensional poverty among them, and how it might differ from that of host communities. Relying on household survey data from selected areas of Ethiopia, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan, this paper proposes a Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) that captures the overlapping deprivations experienced by poor individuals in contexts of displacement. Using the MPI, the paper presents multi-country descriptive analysis to explore the relationships between multidimensional poverty, displacement status, and gender of the household head. The results reveal significant differences across displaced and host communities in all countries except Nigeria. In Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Sudan, female-headed households have higher MPIs, while in Somalia, those living in male-headed households are more likely to be identified as multidimensionally poor. Lastly, the paper examines mismatches and overlaps in the identification of the poor by the MPI and the $1.90/day poverty line, confirming the need for complementary measures when assessing deprivations among people in contexts of displacement.;Other;Sub-Saharan Africa;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-21;"Admasu, Yeshwas;ĘAlkire, Sabina; Ekhator-Mobayode, UcheĘEseosa;ĘKovesdi, Fanni;ĘSantamaria, Julieth;ĘScharlin-Pettee, Sophie";http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/492181635479693932/A-Multi-Country-Analysis-of-Multidimensional-Poverty-in-Contexts-of-Forced-Displacement;Migration, Poverty;
Breaking the Metal Ceiling: Female Entrepreneurs Who Succeed in Male-Dominated Sectors;A range of reasons is cited to explain gender differences in business performance in Africa. Within those, the sector of operations is consistently identified as a major issue. This paper uses a mixed methods approach to assess how women entrepreneurs in Uganda start (and strive) operating firms in male-dominated sectors, and what hinders other women from doing so. The study finds that women who cross over into male-dominated sectors make as much as men, and three times more than women who stay in female-dominated sectors. The paper examines a set of factors to explain the differences in sector choices, and finds that there is a problem of information about opportunities in male-dominated industries. The analysis also concludes that psychosocial factors, particularly the influence of male role models and exposure to the sector from family and friends, are critical in helping women circumvent or overcome the norms that undergird occupational segregation.;Other;East Africa;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-15;"Campos, Francisco; Goldstein, Markus; McGorman, Laura; Munoz Boudet, Ana Maria; Pimhidzai, Obert";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/23469;Entrepreneurship, Norms;

Intimate Partner Violence and Household Decision Making Autonomy: Effects of the Malian Conflict on Women;Rates of intimate partner violence vary widely across regions. Evidence suggests that some of this variation can be attributed to exposure to armed conflict. This study exploits variation in the timing and location of conflict events related to the war in Mali to examine the effect of conflict on intimate partner violence and some womenŐs empowerment outcomes. The study used data from the Demographic and Health Survey spatially linked to conflict data from the Armed Conflict Location and Events Database. Wartime conflict increases the prevalence of womenŐs experiences of intimate partner violence. It also increases womenŐs household decision making autonomy but decreases womenŐs ability to decide how their earnings are deployed. The results imply that to be successful, programs to mitigate these adverse effects of conflict on women need to be context specific and rely on data-driven evidence from situations of conflict whenever possible. Policy makers are called to design programs that address harmful gender norms and intimate partner violence at the individual/household and community levels, especially for women residing in areas with high-intensity conflict.

Effect of Armed Conflict on Intimate Partner Violence: Evidence from the Boko Haram Insurgency in Nigeria;Intimate partner violence is the most common form of violence against women in conflict and non-conflict settings, but in conflict settings it often receives less attention than other forms of gender-based violence, such as conflict-related sexual violence. Using data from the 2008 and 2013 Domestic Violence module of the Nigerian Demographic and Health Survey spatially linked to the Boko Haram actor file of the Armed Conflict Location and Events Database, this paper employs a kernel-based difference-in-difference model to examine the effect of the Boko Haram insurgency on women's experience of physical and sexual intimate partner violence. It also examines the effect of the Boko Haram insurgency on women's experience of controlling behavior from a husband or partner, women's autonomy in household decision making, and their control over their own earnings. The paper finds that the Boko Haram insurgency is associated with slower progress toward preventing and eliminating women's experiences of physical and sexual intimate partner violence. Controlling behaviors from husbands/partners and reductions in women's autonomy in household decision making are heightened in locations that are impacted by the Boko Haram insurgency, indicating that the Boko Haram insurgency adversely affects women's agency and exacerbates behaviors that are often precursors to intimate partner violence.;Gender-Based Violence (GBV);West Africa;Working paper;World Bank Group;Mar-20;"Ekhator-Mobayode,UcheĘEseosa;ĘHanmer,Lucia C.; RubianoĘMatulevich,ElianaĘCarolina;ĘArango,DianaĘJimena";http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/807641583160047607/Effect-of-Armed-Conflict-on-Intimate-Partner-Violence-Evidence-from-the-Boko-Haram-Insurgency-in-Nigeria;Gender-Based Violence (GBV), External Shocks, FCV;
Towards a More Inclusive Economy: Understanding the Barriers Sudanese Women and Youth Face in Accessing Employment Opportunities;The provision and access to quality employment opportunities, especially for women and youth, is instrumental in achieving inclusive growth and more effective development outcomes. However, women and youth are particularly disadvantaged in the Sudanese labor market. Understanding gender- and youth-specific issues can help identify entry points for greater employment opportunities for women and youth in Sudan. They can also help shape actions for enhanced growth and sustainability. The objective of this study, which builds on mixed methods research, is to contribute to a better understanding of the current situation, challenges, and constraints that women and youth face in accessing employment opportunities. To identify and examine these challenges and constraints, the study applies a conceptual framework derived from the World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality and Development analytical framework. More specifically, the study examines the role of informal institutions, formal institutions, and markets as they relate to employment-related outcomes for women and youth in Sudan. The study analyzes how these aspects influence intra-household decision-making processes, especially as they relate to the participation of women and youth in the economic sphere. These decisions directly affect individual-level endowments and agency, including access to economic opportunities. The study documents that Sudanese customs and norms affect women?s roles in society, and young people are less likely to participate in the labor force and be employed compared to adults. The findings call for policy actions to improve access of women and youth to employment opportunities.;Access to Jobs;East Africa;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-22;"Etang Ndip, Alvin; Lundvall, Jonna Maria; Osman, Eiman Adil Mohamed; Wistrand, Jennifer Solveig";https://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-10244;Norms, Youth, Employment Access & Opportunities;
How Do Women Fare in Rural Non-Farm Economy?;This paper studies the gender-based differences in access to and return from economic activities in the rural non-farm economy (RNFE) using panel datasets from Uganda and Ethiopia. The results show that female-headed households have limited access to paid employment and self-employment in the sector, particularly in some industries. These households also earn lower returns from RNFE than male-headed households, and the gross return gap is much higher in Uganda than in Ethiopia. Furthermore, endowment differences do not explain the return gap in Ethiopia, and only partially explain the gap in Uganda.;Access to Jobs;East Africa;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-17;Fuji, Habtamu;http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26952;Employment Access & Opportunities, Economic Empowerment, Rural;
Poverty and Gender in Malawi: A Background Paper for the 2021 Malawi Poverty Assessment;The paper, which serves as a gender background paper for the 2021 Malawi Poverty Assessment, is structured as follows. It first presents the data and empirical strategy. Chapter two presents poverty data and discusses the intersection of poverty and gender. Poverty by household composition is essential for understanding gendered differences in poverty. From there, chapter three explores gender disparities in economic opportunities, following the analytical framework cited earlier. The authors will then move to potential drivers of economic outcomes: endowments (chapter four) and agency (chapter five).

Differences in Household Composition: Hidden Dimensions of Poverty and Displacement in Somalia;Little is known about how gender inequality influences poverty rates of forcibly displaced people. This paper uses a nationally representative survey to analyze poverty among internally displaced people and non-displaced people in Somalia. More than half of internally displaced peopleŐs households and 47 percent of non-displaced peopleŐs households are female headed. Although poverty rates are higher among internally displaced people than non-displaced people (77 versus 66 percent), male-headed households are poorer than female-headed ones among both groups. Extending the analysis beyond headship to demographic characteristics and by the gender and number of earners provides a more nuanced picture. Demographic characteristics are strongly associated with poverty rates for internally displaced people but not for non-displaced people. Having more income earners reduces poverty risk for all households. For internally displaced peopleŐs households, the largest decrease in poverty risk is associated with having more female earners, while having more male earners is associated with the lowest poverty for nondisplaced peopleŐs households. The analysis highlights that poverty reduction policies and programs must cover all households and lift barriers to womenŐs economic opportunities. Programs that respond to womenŐs care responsibilities and address barriers to womenŐs economic opportunities are especially important for internally displaced people.;Other;East Africa;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-21;"Hanmer, Lucia C.; Rubiano-Matulevich, Eliana; Santamaria, Julieth";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/36469;Migration, External Shocks, Poverty;
What Explains Wage Differentials for the Urban Wage Earners? : Returns to Education for EthiopiaŐs Urban Wage Employed;The Ethiopian labor market is facing the dual challenge of creating new employment opportunities for the rapidly expanding labor force and improving the quality of existing jobs in the labor market. This paper estimates an earnings function for the urban wage-employed to understand how investment in human capital shapes labor market outcomes and to what extent human capital returns have been realized. The key findings show that there are significant gains associated with acquiring higher levels of education in the urban labor market. Interestingly, the analysis also finds that the margin of completed primary compared to incomplete primary education is critical in explaining earning gains. This finding has important implications for education policies in Ethiopia, a country in which about 5 percent of gross domestic product is invested in education annually, with nearly half of the budget earmarked for tertiary-level education. Understanding the returns from various levels of education, in different sectors, regions, as well as gender gaps in earnings is critical for thinking about public investment choices and labor market policies that can support nudging market inclusiveness, equity, and efficiency. Investments by the government aimed at incentivizing completion of primary education can go a long way in ensuing higher wages and improving standards of living in Ethiopia.;Access to Jobs, Human Capital;East Africa;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-21;"Nath, Shanjukta; Wieser, Christina";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/36737;Poverty, Education, Employment Access & Opportunities;

Impact of Conflict on Adolescent Girls in South Sudan;Violent conflict and instability affect men and women in heterogeneous ways, including differentiated impacts on economic, social, physical, and mental well-being. This study assesses the impact of the post-2013 conflict in South Sudan on adolescent girls and young women. The analysis uses data from the Adolescent Girls Initiative endline survey and the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data to measure conflict exposure using constructed cluster-level, self-reported, and external conflict exposure variables. The impact of conflict exposure is then estimated on a set of socioeconomic outcomes of adolescent girls by comparing exposed and non-exposed clusters before and after the conflict. The results suggest that girls from clusters more affected by the conflict had statistically different outcomes compared with girls from less affected clusters. Specifically, there is strong evidence that the conflict negatively affected outcomes related to income opportunities, aspirations, marriage, and household characteristics, but increased self-reported empowerment and entrepreneurial potential scores. The results indicate that impacts on labor supply, personal motivation, household conditions, and other forms of victimization are important channels through which conflict negatively impacts adolescent girls.;Other;East Africa;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-18;"Pape, Utz; Phipps, Verena";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/29983;Economic Empowerment, External Shocks, Youth;
Child Stature, Maternal Education, and Early Childhood Development;This paper uses Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys data from the Republic of Congo and S‹o TomŽ and Pr’ncipe to study the relationships between child stature, mother's years of education, and indicators of early childhood development. The relationships are contrasted between two empirical approaches: the conventional approach whereby control variables are selected in an ad-hoc manner and the double machine-learning approach that employs data-driven methods to select controls from a much wider set of variables. Overall, the findings based on the preferable double machine-learning approach differ across the two countries depending on the measures of early childhood development and child stature (height-for-age Z-score and stunting) used in the analysis. Double machine-learning estimates for the Republic of Congo suggest that height-for-age Z-score and stunting have a direct causal effect on early childhood development. In contrast, for S‹o TomŽ and Pr’ncipe, no relationship is found. Thus, country-specific policy advice based on the relationships observed from data in other countries may be quite risky, if not misleading. Double machine-learning provides a practical and feasible approach to reducing threats to internal validity to derive robust inferences based on observational data for evidence-based policy advice.;Human Capital;Central Africa;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-20;"Skoufias, Emmanuel;ĘVinha, Katja";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/34482;Children, Health;

Making Inroads for Women: A Qualitative Study on Constraints and Opportunities of WomenŐs Equal Participation in the Roads Sector in Malawi;The study aims to understand the constraints to womenŐs equal participation in the roads sector inMalawi to inform the development of interventions to promote gender equality in the sector. The study adopts a career cycle approach that allows to identify and describe the barriers to career progression for women in the roads sector at each stage in the career cycle focusing on: attraction, selection, retention, and advancement. The study employs qualitative research methods consisting of focus group discussions with women and girls along the career cycle in the roads sector and key informant interviews. The study has yielded insights into the multiple and overlapping factors embedded in the socialization, learning and hiring processes that result inhigh rates of attrition of women in the engineering and roads-related technical field at different stages of the career cycle, often called the Ňleaky pipelineÓ in policy discussions about women in STEM. From secondary school through university and vocational schools, female students report less confidence and aspiration in engineering and vocational training in the roads sector. At the selection stage, women face gender bias in hiring and difficult work environment, representing an exodus of talent among women who could otherwise become the next generation of architects, engineers, and roads sector contractors. At the retention and advancement phase women confront a difficult work environment where women are sidelined from career advancement opportunities, face sexual harassment and have difficulty balancing work and family obligations in a sector wheremany of the opportunities are in remote locations. The roads sector in Malawi offers opportunitiesfor women: opportunities in the forms of generating substantial incomes, designing transport infrastructure to foster socio-economic development, and providing role models for the young women of the future. Increasing the gender balance in the roads sector requires a comprehensive and multi-sectoral approach and one that needs to address the underlying causes that subtly results in gender stereotypes and gendered occupational cultures and career choices.

Lesotho - Sharing growth by reducing inequality and vulnerability: choices for change - a poverty, gender, and social assessment;"Lesotho began a structural economic transformation in the early 1990s. The transformation has brought higher, more secure incomes to households while the government succeeded in dramatically improving access to services such as education, health, water, and transportation. Yet today, Lesotho faces a number of serious development challenges, including a high rate of chronic poverty, entrenched income inequality, and most troubling one of the highest HIV/AIDS prevalence rates in the world. This report focuses on three main areas: i) livelihood patterns among Lesotho's households and how these correlate with opportunity and exclusion; ii) how the government could make access to public services and overall social development more equitable; and iii) how the economic and social vulnerabilities of households, including HIV/AIDS, could be alleviated in order to reduce poverty. In this report concludes that it is possible for Lesotho to reduce poverty and to continue its transition to an economically diverse middle-income country by undertaking three key strategies: continuing to develop the investment climate for labor-intensive production; implementing programs to support commercial agriculture and reduce land degradation in rural areas; and developing a strategy to support socioeconomic and geographic mobility of workers into higher-productivity sectors. Public funds should be better targeted towards assisting the poor to build human capital and manage risks. Other recommendations to improve the plight of the people of Lesotho include creating a more equitable and inclusive society, especially for women, and developing a more effective campaign against HIV/AIDS.";Human Capital, Other, Access to and Use of Services;Southern Africa;Report;World Bank Group;Jan-21;World Bank;http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/702741468326219287/Lesotho-Sharing-growth-by-reducing-inequality-and-vulnerability-choices-for-change-a-poverty-gender-and-social-assessment;Rural, Agriculture, Transportation & Mobility, Poverty, Education, Basic Services, Productivity;

Gender Relations in Europe and Central Asia : Results from the Life in Transition Survey Third;This report presents a detailed gender analysis of the Life in Transition Survey Third (LITS Third), conducted in 2015-2016 in thirty-four countries of the Europe and Central Asia region. LITS is a unique dataset as it covers for the first-time issues related to asset ownership, care need in the household and gender norms. In addition, in a subset of the households that participated information was collected for both men and women allowing an analysis of gender intra-household dynamics. In total, over 51,000 respondents were covered in the survey. The results indicate that while gender relations, views, and womenŐs access and use of some opportunities have transitioned to more egalitarian ones, women still face challenges to fully participate in economic activity and have an equal say in household decision-making.

Can regulations make it more difficult to serve the poor? The case of childcare services in Istanbul, Turkey;Private and community-driven efforts can be an important resource to expand early childhood education and care (ECEC) services to poor children, under the right conditions and design. The regulations imposed on private ECEC provision, while having an impact on quality, may increase costs of provision and in return prices of services, reducing accessibility and affordability for poor households. This paper considers the impact of regulations on private ECEC in a highly regulated childcare market in a developing country. Using data from a recently fielded survey that sampled 141 private ECEC facilities in Istanbul, Turkey, the paper looks at the impact of fixed regulations on prices and poor childrenŐs access to services, in particular the outdoor space requirement that was originally imposed on private providers in the 1960s and has over time become more difficult to fulfill in densely populated districts of the city. The paper estimates that controlling for other provider characteristics, in districts where such requirement is more binding, the price of childcare services increases by 376.2 TL per child per month and the percentage of children enrolled coming from poor backgrounds lowers by 15.1% points than in districts where such standard proves less challenging.;Access to and Use of Services;Europe, Central Asia;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-16;Aran, M.

Why should we care about care? Supply and Demand Assessment of Care Services in Georgia: A Mixed Methods Study;"Only 58 percent of Georgian women ages 15 and above participate in the labor market, a slightly higher share than the Europe (51 percent) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (51.3 percent) average but 20 percentage points lower than the share among men in the country. Moreover, the gender gap in labor force participation has been constant and around 18 to 20 percentage points over the last decade. Married women living in households with children under age six are at a higher disadvantage in the labor market; only 50 percent of them participate in the labor force compared to 84 percent of men with similar characteristics.The conflicting demand on womenŐs time for care and work activities represents a fundamental barrier to economic participation and generates a vicious circle of low labor market attachment and prominence of the care provider role that leads to increased vulnerability and gender-based inequalities. About 60 percent of working-age women not looking for a job in Georgia cite family responsibilities as the main reason (the share is 67 percent among married ones). In the case of men, this percentage is 21 percent. Georgia cannot afford to underutilize a large share of women whose lifetime productivity in the labor market is currently reduced by informal and at-home care provision. In fact, for Georgia, it has been estimated that differences in labor market activity rates between men and women amount to potential economic losses in gross domestic product per capita of approximately 11 percent (Cuberes and Teignier 2016a, 2016b). Policy options to appropriately address the challenges identified in this note include the expansion ofpublicly and privately provided childcare centers in both urban and rural areas, establishment ofeducation and accreditation programs to prepare caregivers and care entrepreneurs, development of aplan to increase quality of services with attention to costs, and design of eldercare system considering the impacts on care recipients, the active aging promotion objective of age-related policies, as well as the impacts on informal and family care providers and their ability to contribute to sustained economic growth.";Access to Jobs, Access to and Use of Services;Eastern Europe;Study;World Bank Group;Jan-19;"Buitrago Hernandez,Sandra Paola; Munoz Boudet,Ana Maria";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/31253;Productivity, Care, Basic Services, Employment Access & Opportunities, Informal Economic Activity;
Exploring the diversity of young people not in employment, education, or training (NEET): the gender profile of NEETs in Georgia and Armenia;The analysis presented in this study points to persistent and high numbers in Georgia and Armenia of youth who are jobless and/or economically inactive and with limited access to learning and/or training opportunities, and these figures are among the highest in the ECA region. As many as 31 percent youth aged 15-29 in Georgia and 33 percent in Armenia are not in employment, education, or training (NEET). In Georgia, the phenomenon is mostly urban, whereas in Armenia itŐs both rural and urban. NEET rates are consistently higher among female than male youth, pointing to the fact that being female is a risk factor itself for labor market exclusion, and gender disparities. In addition to gender gaps, there are important gender differences in the condition of those who are NEET: economic inactivity Đ in the form of homemaking and/or caregiving work - is the most prevalent condition among NEET women, whereas unemployment is the most common status among NEET men. With regards to education, Georgia and Armenia stand out as cases where higher educational attainment does not necessarily prevent young people from becoming NEETs, and the NEET rate among higher education graduates is even bigger (particularly among women) than for those with lower education. This is a strong sign of mismatch between the demand and supply side of labor market.

How costly are labor gender gaps? estimates for the Balkans and Turkey;In this paper, survey data are used to document the presence of gender gaps in self-employment, employership, and labor force participation in seven Balkan countries and Turkey. The paper examines the quantitative effects of the gender gaps on aggregate productivity and income per capita in these countries. In the model used to carry out this calculation, agents choose between being workers, self-employed, or employers, and women face several restrictions in the labor market. The data display very large gaps in labor force participation and in the percentage of employers and self-employed in the labor force. In almost all cases, these gaps reveal a clear underrepresentation of women. The calculations show that, on average, the loss associated with these gaps is about 17 percent of income per capita. One-third of this loss is due to distortions in the choice of occupations between men and women. The remaining two-thirds corresponds to the costs associated with gaps in labor force participation. The dimensions of these gender gaps and their associated costs vary considerably across age groups, with the age bracket 36Đ50 years being responsible for most of the losses.;Access to Jobs;Eastern Europe, Central Asia;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-15;"Cuberes,David; Teignier,Marc";http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/999501467991022574/How-costly-are-labor-gender-gaps-estimates-for-the-Balkans-and-Turkey;Entrepreneurship, Employment Access & Opportunities, Discrimination;
Maternity leave and womenŐs labor market status in Kosovo: five key messages;"Labor market engagement of women is very low in Kosovo - only 12.5 percent of women of working age are employed compared to 41.3 percent of men - suggesting that women face obstacles to work and or being hired. These barriers can be related to a multiplicity of factors, including labor regulations - such as maternity provisions - but also others such as disincentives to work from taxes and social protection systems; limited flexible work arrangements; limited access to information, networks, and productive inputs such as credit; and lack of access to childcare, coupled with social norms and attitudes towards women. This note focuses specifically on regulations related to maternity and family leave, and their potential impact on womenŐs labor market outcomes. Legislation on maternity leave in Kosovo was enacted with the law on labor on December 2010, providing mothers to nine months of paid leave and three months of unpaid leave. The note is organized around five main messages that emerge from reviewing the evidence of the impact of maternity leave on female labor force participation and employment, both through international benchmarking of maternity leave duration and payment forms in Kosovo, review of existing studies, and through data collection and analysis of Kosovo-specific qualitative evidence.";Access to Jobs, Ownership and Use of Economic Assets, Access to and Use of Services;Eastern Europe;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-18;"Davalos,ĘMariaĘEugenia;ĘElezaj,ĘEreblina;ĘThurau,ĘJuliannaĘFlanagan;ĘRodriguez Chamussy, Lourdes";http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/355271521449544766/Maternity-leave-and-women-s-labor-market-status-in-Kosovo-five-key-messages;Employment Access & Opportunities, Care, Basic Services, Norms, Access to Capital & Productive Inputs, Social Protection;
Gender in Waiting: Men and Women Asylum Seekers in European Reception Facilities;This paper explores how men and women experience their time waiting for a response to applications for international protection, in asylum seekersŐ reception centers in Italy and Greece. The experience of waiting in camps can be characterized as one of extended uncertainty, during which women and men live lives in a new environment, with limited physical and social interactions with local communities. Qualitative data collected in early 2017 reveals that these prolonged waits generate various vulnerabilities, some compounding those already caused by trying journeys, which include gender-specific vulnerabilities. In addition, the paper provides an overview of the aspirations men and women asylum seekers hold as they look at the future. These aspirations are informed by pre-existing gender and social norms, but their development appears to be influenced also by the time in waiting. Specifically, aspirations seem constrained for all by the high levels of uncertainty and duration of the legal process, as well as by limited information, and barriers to interactions with local communities. Thus, men and women miss out on opportunities to qualify or broaden their aspirations, as they wait. Taking into account the different challenges and opportunities men and women asylum seekers face may be helpful in devising more targeted and thus effective policies with regards to asylum seekers during this period in waiting.;Other;Western Europe;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-19;"Demarchi, Giorgia; Lenehan, Sara";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/31209;Migration, External Shocks, Other;
Gender Gaps in Albania through the Lens of Poverty and Shared Prosperity: Findings from the 2012 LSMS;This report analyzes gender dimensions of poverty and shared prosperity in Albania using data from the most recent rounds of the Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) Albania. The goal is understand both the distribution of poverty and lower economic outcomes for women and the underlying gender gaps contributing to these disparities. Two frameworks are used: the ECA Region Shared Prosperity Framework, which analyzes how productive assets create prosperity at the household level, and the World Development Report on Gender and Development, which presents an explicitly gendered framework in which individuals, households, and institutions interact.3 The report considers household composition, education, labor force participation and outcomes, social transfers, social capital, access to technology, and subjective poverty. The period available in the data, from 2008 to 2012, corresponds to the global financial crisis, which had a severe impact on the Albanian economy. This provides the opportunity to examine how key outcomes for women changed in a period of economic downturn. The report provides a rapid, broad overview of gender gaps based on new data from the 2012 LSMS, in the context of the Shared Prosperity and WDR frameworks. It examines gender differences between who is poor and in the bottom 40 percent of the population, and how they have changed since 2008. To understand the causes of gendered differences in poverty, the report then looks at gaps in key assets, asset use, wages, and transfers between men and women in 2012, as well as whether these gaps have widened or narrowed since 2008. The report is not meant to provide a complete and updated gender diagnostic for Albania, which would require review of policies and institutions and how they impact womenŐs endowments, use of endowments, and ability to benefit from the returns to endowments. The 2012 data also do not provide a complete picture of gender in marginalized ethnic communities or specific rural areas, because the survey design did not oversample these groups. This report uses primarily the official definition of poverty as those in households with per-person consumption of less than the national poverty line (6,412new lek/month). However, the final sections on social capital and participation and subjective poverty address some additional components of poverty included in more comprehensive definitions, individual experiences with poverty, ability to participate in society, and ability to access basic needs.;Other;Eastern Europe;Report;World Bank Group;Jan-12;"Golla, Anne Marie; D‡valos, Mar’a E";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/25205;Poverty;
Occupational Segregation and Declining Gender Wage Gap: The Case of Georgia;This paper examines the role of industrial and occupational segregation in explaining the gender wage gap and its evolution in Georgia between 2004 and 2015. It first documents the declining trends observed in the gender wage gap in Georgia during this period, commenting on some of the possible underlying factors driving such trends. It then presents evidence that employment patterns by industry and occupations are highly concentrated in the country and measures the degree of segregation using the Duncan index. Next, it analyzes if and how much industrial and occupational segregation have contributed to the gender wage gap and its decline by decomposing the gender wage gap into the within-category and between-category components. The results point to existing gender wage gaps within sectors, industries, and occupations being the primary drivers of the wage gap in Georgia, and find a smaller role of gender segregation per se in these categories.;Access to Jobs;Eastern Europe;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-18;"Khitarishvili, Tamar; Rodriguez-Chamussy, Lourdes; Sinha, Nistha";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/30428;Gender Pay Gap, Private Sector;
The Gender Gap in the Use of Financial Services in Turkey;"In this paper authors discuss environmental factors that might help explain the significantly low use of financial services by women in Turkey. For instance, The Gender Gap Report (2013) provides a cross-country rank and score across several socio-economic dimensions. Turkey ranks poorly - 120 out of 136 countries overall. In addition, associated employment data from the Gallup World Poll Survey shows a large gender gap in workforce participation in Turkey and suggests important implications for female workplace participation, 98 percent of wage employed women in Turkey are banked, as compared to 23 percent of the majority of women who report being out of the workforce. This paper proceeds as follows. Section two summarizes account ownership and usage in Turkey. Section three analyzes formal and informal saving rates; section four discusses the use of formal and informal credit and the high use of store credit cards. Section five examines gender differences in enterprise financing. Section six concludes.

Why should we care about care? : the role of childcare and eldercare in Kosovo;Despite an increase in female labor participation between 2012 and 2013, 79 percent of women of working age remain out of the labor market in Kosovo. The conflicting demand of womenŐs time for care and work activities represents a fundamental barrier to economic participation and generates a vicious circle of low labor market attachment and prominence of the care provider role that leads to increased vulnerability and gender-based inequalities. This note examines the care needs of families with children and or elderly household members and the provision of formal care services in Kosovo with an emphasis on the availability, price, and quality characteristics.

Why should we care about care? The role of childcare and eldercare in former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia;This note examines the provision of childcare and eldercare in FYR Macedonia with an emphasis on the availability, price, and quality of care, and suggests policy priorities that address the identified challenges. The analysis in this note is based on a study aimed at exploring childcare and eldercare in the Western Balkans region, drawing primarily from a new mixed-methods dataset, described in the following section, and building on relevant quantitative surveys and data sources specific to Western Balkans countries. The note is structured as follows: section two introduces the new, independent mixed methods data set that is the basis for the analysis and findings presented. Section three describes the use of formal care arrangements in FYR Macedonia, based on the analysis of perspectives both from families with care needs and from care providers and discussing the role of norms and perceptions of childcare and eldercare use, the following sections are dedicated to the description of supply and demand of childcare and eldercare, respectively. Sections four and five focuses on the supply and demand of childcare, and sections six and seven describe supply and demand of eldercare.

Women and STEM in Europe and Central Asia;In the last decades, developed economies have witnessed significant declines in wages for low-skill workers, increases in employment in high-skill occupations, rapid diffusion of new technology, and expanding offshoring opportunities. Labor markets in developed countries have reallocated labor from manual to cognitive jobs and from routine to non-routine work. Overall, workers are now required to do more complex tasks than before. In a changing labor market, education systems should impart the right skills, ideally both foundational ones and additional skills that will be amenable to adaptation and re-training to match with job opportunities. This is even more important in the ECA region given the context of the increasing share of older people who will depend on todayŐs generation of children when they join the working age population. WomenŐs access to and progress in what is generally referred to as STEM fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are topics that have been growing in significance in recent years. The interest in gender segregation in STEM, as in other sectors, arises mainly from the role segregation plays in gender inequality in the labor markets. Gender differences in productivity and earnings are systematic and persistent as women exhibit lower average productivity and earn lower wages than men across the board. The report is organized into three chapters. The first one looks at education - including STEM content and fields of study that are within the education realm. The second one follows women into the labor market and looks at employment and wages in STEM sectors and for STEM occupations. The final section looks at policies, from the many initiatives and efforts in place to promote womenŐs participation in STEM, with a focus on those that have documented results.;Human Capital, Access to Jobs;Europe, Central Asia;Report;World Bank Group;Jan-21;"Munoz Boudet,Ana Maria; Rodriguez Chamussy,Lourdes; Oral Savonitto,Isil; Chiarella,Christina";http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/306791618914384894/Women-and-STEM-in-Europe-and-Central-Asia;Education, Productivity, Employment Access & Opportunities;
Gender Discrimination in Hiring: Evidence from an Audit Experiment in Uzbekistan;This paper studies gender discrimination in hiring through an experiment that randomly assigned fictitious resumes to job advertisements in Uzbekistan. The experiment focused on positions commonly advertised in the local context, such as accountants, office managers, information technology specialists, welders, call center operators, and drivers in the capital city. With the single exception of the applicant's gender (signaled by the person's name), the resumes were identical within each job category. The study finds strong evidence of prevalent and economically significant gender discrimination in response rates. Despite identical qualifications, we find that in female-dominated professions, women were 185 percent more likely to get a callback than men, and in male-dominated professions, men were 79 percent more likely to get a callback than women. The findings suggest strong gender discrimination in hiring practices in Uzbekistan.;Access to Jobs, Other;Central Asia;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-21;"Muradova, Sevilya; Seitz, William";https://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-9784;Discrimination, Norms, Employment Access & Opportunities;
A Field Experiment on the Role of Socioemotional Skills and Gender for Hiring in Turkey;A vast literature shows the importance of socioemotional skills in earnings and employment, but whether they matter in getting hired remains unanswered. This study seeks to address this question and further investigates whether socioemotional skill signals in job applicants' resumes have the same value for male and female candidates. In a large-scale randomized audit study, an online job portal in Turkey is used to send fictitious resumes to real job openings, collecting a unique data set that enables investigating different stages of candidate screening. The study finds that socioemotional skills appear to be valued only when an employer specifically asks for such skills in the vacancy ad. When not asked for, however, candidates can face a penalty in the form of lower callback rates. A significant penalty is only observed for women, not for men. The study does not find evidence of other gender differences in the hiring process.;Other;Europe, Central Asia;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-20;"Nas Ozen, Efsan; Hut, Stefan; Levin, Victoria; Munoz Boudet, Ana Maria";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/33359;Norms, Employment Access & Opportunities, Private Sector;
When Do Gender Wage Differences Emerge? : A Study of Azerbaijan's Labor Market;Building on recent analyses that find a sizeable overall gender wage gap in Azerbaijan's workforce, this paper uses data on young workers in their early years in the labor market to understand how gender wage gaps evolve over time, if at all. The paper uses a unique database from a survey of young people ages 15Đ29 years. The analysis provides evidence that new labor market entrants begin with little or no gender differences in earnings, but a wage gap gradually emerges over time closer to the childbearing years. The gender wage gap grows from virtually zero, or even a small, positive gap in favor of women, until age 20 years, to about 20 percent two years later and even more than 30 percent at age 29 years. The gap in labor supply rises from almost zero to about 20 percent during the years from 19 to 22, while the gap in hours worked falls from positive (up to six hours per week more than their male counterparts) to negative (up to five hours per week less) over the same period in the life cycle. When decomposing the gap at different deciles of the wage distribution, it appears that most of it is at the lower and upper ends of the distribution, among young adults and prime-age workers. Selection of women into employment is strong and strongly skill-based: when controlling for sample selection bias, the gender gap becomes positive.;Other;Eastern Europe;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-16;"Pastore, Francesco; Sattar, Sarosh; Sinha, Nistha; Tiongson, Erwin R.";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/24155;Gender Pay Gap, Care, Youth;
The Economics of the Gender Wage Gap in Armenia;"In Armenia, the proportion of women among employed workers increased from 45 to 48 percent between 2008 and 2015. This evolution was accompanied by a fall in the gender earnings gap; however, the difference in average wages of men and women is still among the largest in comparison with countries in the Europe and Central Asia region. This study documents the gender wage gap in Armenia through stylized facts and further investigates its sources. The paper finds that the gender wage gap in hourly pay is 20 percent on average. Looking at the different percentiles, the disparity in wages in Armenia in 2015 shows an inverted U-shaped form with a larger differential in wages between men and women in the middle of the distribution. Using a reweighted, re-centered influence function decomposition, the analysis estimates the contribution of each covariate on the wage structure and composition effects along the wage distribution. The decomposition shows that the wage gap in Armenia is mostly driven by the wage structure effect (unexplained component), which accounts for almost all the wage gap in the middle part of the distribution (30th to 55th percentiles) and is even greater at the top, but better endowments of women offset it to some extent. In the bottom part of the distribution however, the composition effect is larger, consistent with lower endowments among women, for example, of skills and human capital.";Human Capital, Other;Eastern Europe;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-18;"Rodriguez-Chamussy, Lourdes; Sinha, Nistha; Atencio, Andrea";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/29711;Gender Pay Gap, Education, Discrimination;
A Structural Model of the Labor Market to Understand Gender Gaps among Marginalized Roma Communities;This paper constructs and estimates a household-level search model to analyze Roma spouses' utility maximization for leisure, home production, and work. The paper aims to explain labor market gender gaps in a marginalized Roma population with low labor market participation rates (males 53 percent and females 17 percent). The analysis uses data from the 2017 Regional Roma Survey for six Western Balkan countries. The simulation results show that the main source for gender differentials in the labor market is the unequal opportunities in favor of males -- not gender preferences or differences in home production productivity. Therefore, most of the gender differences in the labor market can be closed by providing wives the same labor market conditions as husbands. Counterfactual policy experiments show that policies that increase the frequency of receiving a job offer, decrease the frequency of laying off workers, and reduce search increase Roma husbands' labor participation. Policies that equalize wages induces more wives to join the labor market and husbands to withdraw from it. This outcome signals that the wage gap is the dimension that deters the greatest number of Roma wives from joining the labor market.;Access to Jobs, Other;Eastern Europe;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-20;"Salazar-Saenz, Mauricio; Robayo-Abril, Monica";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/34484;Gender Pay Gap, Employment Access & Opportunities, Economic Empowerment;
Kosovo:ĘGender Gaps in Education, Health, and Economic Opportunities;"Kosovo is one of the poorest countries in Europe (World Bank 2010). In 2009, 35 percent of the population lived below the poverty line.

The note provides a broad picture of gender disparities in Kosovo in education, health, and access to economic opportunities. Lack of statistical data on Kosovo, and particularly of gender-disaggregated data, limits the depth and scope of this gender diagnostic. Men and women in Kosovo have lower education levels than men and women in the European Union (EU). Women comprise less than 10 percent of all entrepreneurs and 0.3 percent of top management positions.

Supply and Demand for Child Care Services in Turkey: A Mixed Methods Study;Despite increases in availability of center based child care and preschool services in Turkey over the last decade, both the supply of services and utilization remain low. There are regional disparities in availability and the majority of children and households remain unserved in terms of child care and preschool services. This report has collected and assessed information on the supply and demand for child care services in Turkey with the objective of identifying key constraints and opportunities to expand quality and affordable access. The analysis in this report shows that current utilization of child care services cannot be construed as lack of demand for services, but rather as a lack of demand for services at existing cost and price-quality structures. Existing services that respond to the needs of working mothers are mainly private services and tend to be more expensively priced than the willingness and ability to pay of the average household. For most women the difference between earnings and the cost of care is too low to justify joining the labor force and their willingness to pay for care does not cover the current median prices for child care and kindergarten services.;Access to and Use of Services;Europe, Central Asia;Report;World Bank Group;Jan-15;World Bank;http://hdl.handle.net/10986/22744;Care, Basic Services;
Why Should We Care About Care? The Role of Childcare and Eldercare in Armenia;Only 56 percent of women ages 15-64 participate in the labor market, a slightly higher share than the Europe and Central Asia average, but 18 percentage points lower than the share among men in Armenia. The conflicting demand on women's time for care and work activities represents a fundamental barrier to economic participation and generates a vicious circle of low labor market attachment and prominence of the care provider role that leads to increased vulnerability and gender-based inequalities. International evidence shows that support for childcare and eldercare affects women's labor market participation. This note examines the care needs of families with children and/or elderly household members and the provision of formal care services in Armenia with an emphasis on the availability, price, and quality characteristics. Based on the analysis of an independent mixed-methods dataset collected in several countries of Europe and Central Asia, this note documents the perceptions and barriers in the use of quality formal care in Armenia. Five main messages emerge from the assessment of supply and demand of formal childcare and eldercare in Armenia: 1) Although social norms strongly highlight the role of women as caregiver, there is scope for policy aimed at increasing access and affordability of childcare and early education: Around 24 percent of parents of children ages 0 to 5 currently not attending kindergarten report that the reason of no attendance is lack of the service or being unable to afford it. 2) The demand for childcare services is voiced predominantly by parents perceiving benefits for their childŐs development and working (or willing-to-work) mothers. 3) Use of childcare is regressive: There are significant differences in enrollment to kindergarten and nursery between the poorest and the richest households (12.7 and 36.4 percent respectively). A well-developed childcare sector not only would help generating economic participation opportunities for women but also implies potential improvements in the school readiness for children especially for the most vulnerable households. 4) Day-care centers and home-based formatsŃif availableŃwill be more compatible with prevailing standards of care for the elderly. 5) Quality is important for potential users of formal care services and the main challenges of the existing supply involves human resources (HR).;Access to and Use of Services, Access to Jobs;Eastern Europe;Technical note;World Bank Group;Jan-15;World Bank;http://hdl.handle.net/10986/32644;Care, Basic Services, Employment Access & Opportunities;
Tackling the Demographic Challenge in Uganda;At the moment, a child born in Uganda will be only 38 percent as productive when she grows up as she can be if she enjoyed complete education and full health, according to the human capital index (HCI) one of the lowest levels in the world. It will be necessary to ensure that the growing population bulge will be engaged in productive economic activities that are adding value to economy. This report examines what it will take for Uganda to tackle the demographic challenge in the next four decades. The report also explores the effort required to ensure that future generations of Ugandans enjoy higher levels of access to basic services, a necessary condition to fully benefit from a demographic transition. The main objective of the report is to inform policymakers and relevant stakeholders in Uganda as they formulate their plans for the medium term. The report is organized as follows: chapter one gives introduction. Chapter two characterizes UgandaŐs progress in terms of its demographic transition, describes its most recent demographic trends, and shows some correlates of the countryŐs fertility levels. The population projections under the medium and low-fertility variants for the period 2020-2060 are presented in chapter three, while chapter four explores the implications in terms of service delivery of these projections under the business as usual and enhanced equilibrium scenarios. Based on these same projections, chapter five presents the expected trends of select labor market and poverty indicators.;Human Capital, Access to and Use of Services;East Africa;Report;World Bank Group;Jan-20;World Bank;http://hdl.handle.net/10986/34676;Education, Youth, Productivity, Basic Services, Health, Children;
Is the baby to blame ? an inquiry into the consequences of early childbearing;Teenage pregnancy has been a cause of concern for policy makers because it is associated with a complex and often adverse social context for women. It is seen as the cause of lower social and economic achievement for mothers and their children, and as the potential determinant of inter-generational poverty traps. However, the question of whether pregnancy -- and the subsequent rearing of a child -- is actually the trigger of poverty, higher dependence on social welfare and/ or other undesirable social and economic consequences has not been studied in developing countries with enough rigor to establish a causal relation. This paper follows a methodology previously applied in the United States, using Mexican data from the National Survey of Demographic Dynamics, to exploit information about miscarriages as an instrument to identify the long-term consequences of early child bearing. Thus, the paper takes the advantage of a natural experiment: it compares the outcomes of women who became pregnant in adolescence, and gave birth, to outcomes of women who became pregnant in adolescence and miscarried. This approach only allows for estimating the costs of adolescent childbearing for teenagers in a risk group, that is, teenagers who are likely to experience a pregnancy. The results are consistent with findings in the United States, suggesting that, contrary to popular thinking, adolescent childbearing does not hamper significantly the lifelong opportunities of the young mothers. Actually, women who gave birth during their adolescence have on average 0.34 more years of education, and are 21 percentage points more likely to be employed, compared with their counterparts who miscarried. The results also suggest, however, greater dependence on social welfare among women who gave birth during adolescence: their social assistance income is 36 percent higher, and they are more likely to participate in social programs, especially the conditional cash transfer program Oportunidades.;Human Capital;Latin America;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-12;"Azevedo,Ę Joao Pedro Wagner De; Lopez-Calva, Luis F.; Perova,Elizaveta";http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/720411468125089861/Is-the-baby-to-blame-an-inquiry-into-the-consequences-of-early-childbearing;Social Protection, Youth, Poverty, Health;
Teenage pregnancy and opportunities in Latin America and the Caribbean on early child bearing, poverty, and economic achievement (Vol. 2) : Teenage pregnancy book;"The pregnancy project sought to expose the existence, and challenge the validity, of stereotypes about Hispanic women. The charade explored the underlying motivations of the many who responded with a wide range of reactions. The specific objectives of this regional study are: to establish a thorough description of the magnitude of the issue and its potential implications for social advancement; to advance the understanding of the risk factors, motivations and impacts at the household level-as a determinant of poverty and a cause of intra-and intergenerational poverty traps; to illuminate the coping mechanisms and their individual and social implications; to highlight the gender-related issues that have historically provoked asymmetric costs to boys and girls; and to provide elements that support specific policies on this matter. In the last decade, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) have been moving in the right direction and the region has experienced important gains in gender equality of endowments (assets) and economic opportunities. In most LAC countries, girls have been achieving gender parity in primary school enrollment and even outperforming boys at the secondary and tertiary level. The present report reviews the factors associated with teenage pregnancy and early childbearing and builds a framework to explore these issues systematically, towards the design of effective policy interventions in LAC. Teen pregnancy and early childbearing remain a challenge in the region, particularly given the association of these phenomena with poverty and lack of opportunities, and the concern that it may prevent women from taking full advantage of their human development assets and opportunities. The main message of the report is that poverty and lack of opportunities are key factors associated to early childbearing.";Human Capital;Latin America, Caribbean;Report;World Bank Group;Jan-13;"Azevedo, Joao Pedro; Favara, Marta; Haddock, Sarah E.; Lopez-Calva, Luis F.; Muller, Miriam; Perova, Elizaveta";http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/638771468017359353/Teenage-pregnancy-book-2013;Poverty, Employment Access & Opportunities, Youth, Health;
Gender Differences in Poverty in Colombia;This note presents the gender poverty profiles for Colombia using a lifecycle approach. In Colombia, as in the vast majority of countries around the world, girls and boys are consistently poorer than adults and seniors. Notwithstanding, the difference on poverty rates between women and men during their reproductive age in Colombia is around 6 p.p. while in the world is around 2 p.p. Another interesting finding is that the likelihood of being poor diminishes with formal education, for both women and men. Nevertheless, as the level of formal education increases, the share of women among the poor do so also. This note is organized as follows: section one presents the poverty rates for women and men, by education level, marital status, location, and employment type. Section two presents the results of the lifecycle approach.

Enhancing Youth Skills and Economic Opportunities to Reduce Teenage Pregnancy in Colombia;"The Government of Colombia (GoC) has identified teenage pregnancy as a priority issue. The current strategic framework to address teenage pregnancy in Colombia is outlined in the CONPES 147, effective from February 2012 until March 2014. The CONPES 147 establishes a multi-sectoral framework that aims to address the determining factors of teenage pregnancy within Colombia (Box 1). The national strategy outlined in the CONPES 147 was piloted in 192 municipalities for youth ages 10 through 19. Building on this strategy, the Commission for the Guarantee of Sexual and Reproductive Rights is developing a new framework to guide the governmentŐs policy and activities to address this important policy issue in the coming years. Parallel to its work on teenage pregnancy, the GoC released a national strategic framework to generate opportunities for Colombian youth in July 2014. The note includes an overview of the WDR 2012 gender equality framework and World Bank regional study on teenage pregnancy; outlines the Colombian country context with regard to gender equality and youth labor market outcomes; reviews interventions that develop life skills; and highlights how these interventions might be relevant to the GoC policies and programs related to teenage pregnancy prevention (CONPES 147) and youth labor (CONPES 173).";Human Capital, Access to Jobs;Latin America;Technical note;World Bank Group;Jan-15;"Gimenez, Lea; Van Wie, Sara Hause; Muller, Miriam; Schutte, Rebecca; Rounseville, Megan Zella; Viveros Mendoza, Martha Celmira";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/22344;Youth, Economic Empowerment, Other, Health;

The objective of this diagnostic is to use a behavioral methodology to uncover the drivers to increase safe birth deliveries in Haiti. The novelty of this diagnostic relies on the use of behavioral science techniques to examine a wider set of influences, paying attention to the social, psychological, and economic factors that affect what people think and do. The behavioral methodology identifies barriers interfering in the decision-making process of pregnant women when seeking, reaching, and receiving care. This note is structured as follows: section two outlines background and context, while section three explains the methodology followed in this diagnostic. Key insights are presented in section four. Section five provides key solutions to improve safe birth deliveries. Finally, section six concludes with a short description of a potential intervention.;Human Capital;Caribbean;Brief;World Bank Group;Jan-19;Llopis Abella, Jimena,_Perge, Emilie Bernadette,_Mathurin, Tania Mindy, &_Afif, Zeina;http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/704141561618181549/Using-Behavioral-Insights-to-Increase-Safer-Birth-Deliveries-in-Haiti;Poverty, Health, Healthcare;
Changes in Female Employment in Mexico : Demographics, Economics, and Policies;The unemployment and labor force participation gender gaps narrowed in Mexico after the 2008 global economic crisis, when female labor force participation increased. This paper aims to understand female labor force participation growth and identify its main determinants. For that purpose, the paper estimates a probit model with data from the National Employment Survey of 2007 and 2017, when the unemployment rate returned to the pre-crisis level. Broadly, the results show that increasing labor force participation of women ages 36 to 65 sustained the growth of overall female labor force participation, women's educational attainment can offset any individual or household obstacle to women's employability, and childcare availability significantly supports mothers' employability.;Access to Jobs, Access to and Use of Services, Human Capital;Latin America;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-20;"Lopez-Acevedo, Gladys; Freije-Rodriguez, Samuel; Vergara Bahena, Mexico Alberto; Cardozo Medeiros, Diego";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/33987;Care, Basic Services, Employment Access & Opportunities, Education;
"""If it's already tough, imagine for me..."" : A Qualitative Perspective on Youth Out of School and Out of Work in Brazil";"Drawing on in-depth interviews with young women and men in rural and urban Brazil, this qualitative research explores gender dimensions in the causes and consequences of being ""out of work and out of school."" A key conclusion from this research is that this term (or the Portuguese: ""nem-nem"") does not translate well the complex realities of this highly heterogeneous group. The paper develops inductively from the data a typology of these youth, who face different barriers along their trajectories: a) barriers to building aspirations and internal motivation to return to school or work, b) barriers to action, and c) external barriers. Participants' position along this spectrum is shaped by social context and gender norms that frame youth's trajectories and envisioned futures. These observed patterns are particularly strong in rural areas, where youth perceive fewer quality economic opportunities and stronger division of gender roles within the household and in farming activities, which keeps young women in lower paid or unpaid roles. Participants who have successful trajectories to technical schools, universities, or formal work demonstrate strong resilience, which seems to be built on their relationships with their families, peers, partners, and role models.";Human Capital, Access to Jobs;Latin America;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-18;"Machado, Ana Luiza; Muller, Miriam";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/29424;Youth, Employment Access & Opportunities, Education;
Fear is What Weighs Most...' Experiences of Women in Situations of Violence in Accessing Support Services in Brazil;"This paper seeks to fill a knowledge gap relative to the low uptake of services for women living in situations of violence. The phenomenon is observed in many countries, including in Brazil, despite its robust legal framework to prevent and protect women from domestic violence. Through qualitative research, this paper explores the experience of women survivors of violence against women (VAW) in seeking help to exit abusive relationships, with the aim of identifying avenues to strengthen service delivery and violence prevention policies. The experiences of research participants demonstrate that a complex set of issues related to social norms, individual agency and institutional weaknesses serve as strong barriers for service uptake. These include women's personal preparedness to seek support; the catalyzing or constraining function that families, friends, peers and people in authority can play; external barriers to accessing services; and the availability and quality of services in different settings. Data from this research also highlight the importance of psycho-social support services that help survivors make informed decisions about how to exit abusive relationships, to rebuild their emotional stability and self-esteem, establish economic autonomy, pursue justice, and ultimately reconstruct their lives.";Gender-Based Violence (GBV), Access to and Use of Services;Latin America;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-20;"Machado, Ana Luiza; Muller, Miriam; Van Wie, Sara";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/33447;Gender-Based Violence (GBV), Norms, Basic Services;

Gender Gaps in Peru : An Overview;"Closing the existing gender gaps will be required to boost shared prosperity and maximize poverty reduction efforts in Peru over the coming years. Gender inequities are not only unfair from an ethical and social perspective, but also economically inefficient. Greater gender equality can raise overall productivity, improve development outcomes, especially of the next generation, and lead to more representative decision making. This review of gender issues aims to uncover the main gender gaps in the country, and to identify potential policy recommendations that could help closing them in the coming years. Chapter 1 covers the legal and institutional framework and the issue of the agency of women; Chapter 2 provides an overview the situation with regards to the main endowments of health and education; and Chapter 3 deals with the existing gender gaps in economic opportunity.";Human Capital, Access to Jobs, Other;Latin America;Report;World Bank Group;Jan-18;"Muller, Miriam; de Paz, Carmen";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/31820;Employment Access & Opportunities, Education, Poverty;
She Helps Me All the Time' : Underestimating Women's Economic Engagement in Rural Honduras;"This study aims to understand women's engagement in economic activities in rural Honduras and why these activities may not be accurately reflected in official statistics. The study finds that women underreport their engagement in economic activities, including production for own consumption, production of market goods, and remunerated services and commerce. Simulations suggest that the rural female labor force participation rate in Honduras is likely to be underestimated by 6 to 23 percentage points. Two main explanations are found. First, women identify themselves (and are identified) primarily as housewives, and the concepts of housework and employment are taken as mutually exclusive. Second, given this duality between housework and employment, women define ""employment"" based on a set of necessary characteristics that exclude many of their own activities. Specifically, work needs to (i) be conducted physically outside the home; (ii) be in exchange for money; and (iii) entail sufficient time commitment. Importantly, these conditions are not binding constraints for men to identify their own activities as economic activity. These results have implications for understanding the low labor force participation of women in rural communities in countries beyond Honduras, suggesting that low rates obscure a significant amount of economic activity in many countries.";Access to Jobs;Central America;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-20;"Muller, Miriam; Sousa, Liliana D";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/33638;Employment Access & Opportunities, Productivity, Care, Rural;
Complex Decisions between Care and Paid Work : A Qualitative Study on the Demand for Childcare Services in Mexico City;"This study aims to improve the understanding of the barriers and enabling factors determining the demand for childcare in Mexico City. The study is based on focus group discussions and individual in-depth interviews with mothers and fathers (married or living in a union) of children ages zero to six years. The findings of this qualitative analysis confirm that for parents in Mexico City, decisions in favor of or against the use of childcare are based on: (1) the interplay between women's aspirations, the role of work in their lives, and the additional support they have; and (2) their perceptions of the care available, including convenience, overall quality, perceived opportunities for positive child development, and financial and non-financial costs (safety and risks to the childŐs well-being). The findings suggest that significant differences exist between women with higher education and those with lower levels of education living in different parts of the city (and from different socioeconomic backgrounds: middle-class vis-a-vis vulnerable women). The observed gaps are due to differences in their ability to make informed choices, their aspirations and work opportunities, the alternative support options available to them, and their ability to adapt to the childcare supply. These results highlight the relevance of: (1) promoting a more balanced distribution of childcare responsibilities between men and women; (2) communicating more transparently the benefits of using childcare services and the measures taken to ensure the safety and positive development of children; and (3) adapting the childcare centers' functioning to the needs of working parents.";Access to and Use of Services, Access to Jobs;Latin America;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-20;"Muller, Miriam; Jaen, Martha";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/34685;Care, Basic Services, Employment Access & Opportunities, Economic Empowerment, Children;
Does the Gender Wage Gap Influence Intimate Partner Violence in Brazil? Evidence from Administrative Health Data;Improving womenŐs economic status has been presented in theory as a protective mechanism against intimate partner violence. Using panel data from 2011Đ16 for the most populous 20 percent of municipalities in Brazil, the analysis tests if the gender wage gap is causally associated with three administrative measures of violence against women: homicides, overnight hospitalizations for assault, and incidents of domestic violence reported by attending health workers about patients. The analysis finds that a narrowing in the gender wage gap leads to a reduction of homicides of women, especially among younger women and in municipalities with a low Human Development Index. The impact on less severe forms of violence, also captured in medical reports, depends on the context. A reduction in the gender wage ratio triggers a decrease in reports in municipalities that have police stations specifically designed to address crimes against women, but it has the opposite impact in the absence of such services. The results suggest that while improvements in gender equality in the labor market curtail the most severe forms of violence against women, they need to be complemented by policies directly focused on womenŐs safety to reduce less severe violence effectively.;Gender-Based Violence (GBV), Other;Latin America;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-21;"Perova, Elizaveta; Reynolds, Sarah Anne; Schmutte, Ian";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/35569;Gender Pay Gap, Gender-Based Violence (GBV), Basic Services;
Improving gender and development outcomes through agency : policy lessons from three Peruvian experiences;Peruvian public policy is currently focused on economic growth with social inclusion. The Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion (MIDIS)-created in October 2011-leads the sector and promotes evidence-based public policy using three strategic guidelines: 1) matching criteria and mechanisms for the selection of areas and target population, 2) generation of instruments for inter-sectorial and inter-governmental result-based coordination, and 3) activation of monitoring and evaluation procedures to measure interventions' progress and results. This study is about the incredible and frequently underestimated role of agency-the ability to make choices to achieve desired outcomes-in economic development. The authors share the view that agency has inherent value for development: it is an attribute and manifestation of development, or using Sen's words, it is constituent to development. This study however, focuses on the instrumental role of agency for more tangible manifestations of development, such as, poverty reduction and economic growth. It attempts to show that expanding individual agency is a powerful catalyst for improving welfare, as measured by these concrete and widely used metrics of policy success. Moreover, it argues that in many cases, improving development outcomes through agency is highly cost-effective. This study centers on several policy initiatives in Peru, which as will be subsequently shown, have improved the agency of their beneficiaries. The purpose of this study is twofold. First, it aims at bridging this information gap, providing a review of evidence that shows how the psychological components of agency, such as aspirations and self-esteem, can effectively contribute to more traditional development objectives-ranging from higher investments in human capital to increased income. Second, the study reviews and synthesizes research on several policy interventions in Peru, which have empowered their beneficiaries. In this way, the study aims to derive practical recommendations on how to incorporate psychological elements of agency into policy interventions in order to achieve better development outcomes. The study is structured as follows: the next section discusses the concept of agency, providing examples of its broad role in achieving development objectives. The following section reviews the quantitative and qualitative research that served as the basis for this study and elaborates on the methodologies used to derive the conclusions presented in the ensuing section.

5 years in Juntos : new evidence on the program's short and long-term impacts;This brief summarizes the results of a gender impact evaluation study, entitled 5 years in Juntos : new evidence on the program's short and long-term impacts, conducted in 2005 till present in Peru. The study observed the impact evaluation of the conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, Juntos, in Peru on the individual level. Participation in the program led to significant improvements in consumption, income, and poverty indicators among beneficiaries. However, the impacts are lower than comparable CCT programs that provide larger benefits. Children from beneficiary households were 69 percent more likely to have received health checks and 55 percent more likely to have sought medical attention when ill. Among women of childbearing age, the likelihood of doctor assisted delivery improved by 91 percent and the contraception use increased 12 percent, other health variables such as experiences of illness and participation in health campaigns showed no impact. There were no significant impacts on child labor or school registration, attendance was significantly improved. The intensity of the impact is greater for those who have been in the program longer.;Human Capital;Latin America;Impact evaluation;World Bank Group;Jan-13;"Perova, Elizaveta; Vakis, Renos";http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/758921468298790391/5-years-in-Juntos-new-evidence-on-the-programs-short-and-long-term-impacts;Education, Health, Social Protection, Children;

WomenŐs police stations and domestic violence : evidence from Brazil;Although womenŐs police centers have been gaining popularity as a measure to address domestic violence, to date no quantitative evaluations of their impacts on the incidence of domestic violence or any other manifestations of gender equality have been done. This paper estimates the effects of womenŐs police stations in Brazil on female homicides, as a measure of the most severe form of domestic violence. Given that a high fraction of female deaths among women ages 15 to 49 years can be attributed to aggression by an intimate partner, female homicides appear the best available proxy for severe domestic violence considering the scarcity of data on domestic violence. The paper uses a panel of 2,074 municipalities and takes advantage of the gradual rollout of womenŐs police stations from 2004 to 2009, to estimate the effect of establishing a womenŐs police station on the municipal female homicide rate. Although the analysis does not find an association on average, womenŐs police stations appear to be highly effective among some groups of women: women living in metropolitan areas and younger women. Establishing a womenŐs police station in a metropolitan municipality is associated with a reduction in the homicide rate by 1.23 deaths per 100,000 women (which roughly amounts to a 17 percent reduction in the average homicide rate in metropolitan municipalities). The reduction in the homicide rate of women ages 15 to 24 is even higher: 5.57 deaths per 100,000 women. Qualitative work suggests that better economic opportunities and less traditional social norms in metropolitan areas may explain the heterogeneous impacts of womenŐs police stations in metropolitan areas and outside them.;Gender-Based Violence (GBV), Access to and Use of Services;Latin America;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-15;"Perova, Elizaveta; Reynolds, Sarah";http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/441331467987820782/Women-s-police-stations-and-domestic-violence-evidence-from-Brazil;Norms, Employment Access & Opportunities, Gender-Based Violence (GBV), Basic Services;
Violence and Newborn Health : Estimates for Colombia;This paper examines the relationship between maternal exposure to violence during pregnancy and newborn birthweight. The paper exploits variation in the timing of exposure and in the geographic location of expectant mothers across Colombian municipalities. Exposure to violence in early pregnancy had a large negative impact on birthweight, primarily for boys, and the effect was mitigated by their mothers' education. Girls were affected mainly by shocks in later stages of gestation. Furthermore, their mothers were more likely to engage in potentially harmful behaviors during the pregnancy.

Do Gender Norms Become Less Traditional with Displacement? The Case of Colombia;Conflict-induced displacement is associated with loss of human and physical capital and psychological trauma. Households and social structures that produce and reproduce gender norms are disrupted, providing opportunities for change. This paper operationalizes a definition of gender norms that brings together the behaviors and attitudes of displaced and non-displaced women using household survey data for Colombia. The results of a two-step estimation involving kernel-based propensity score matching and multilevel linear regression models show that gender norms condoning violence against women relax with displacement, while those that limit womenŐs economic opportunities become more rigid. The findings also reveal a misalignment between attitudes and behaviors in other domains. Displaced women have less rigid patriarchal attitudes, but their ability to decide about contraception and their own earnings decreases following displacement.;Other;Latin America;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-21;Rubiano-Matulevich, Eliana Carolina;http://hdl.handle.net/10986/36473;FCV, Norms, Migration;

Intimate Partner Violence against Women: Prevalence, Formal Reporting, and Risk Factors in Chile;Intimate partner violence is among the most common forms of violence against women. In Chile, one in four women who have been in a partner relationship report having experienced some type of partner violence in the past 12 months, whether psychological, physical, sexual, or economic. However, only 22 percent of female victims of intimate partner violence file a formal complaint. This study analyzes the factors that determine the likelihood that a woman will be subject to violence perpetrated by her partner or ex-partner and the factors that determine the probability of reporting the abuse. Individual factors that increase women's risk of experiencing intimate partner violence include being young, having fewer years of education, having a disability, and having been a victim of sexual abuse in childhood. Other factors include characteristics of partners or ex-partners associated with aggressive behavior in public spaces, having been a victim of intrafamily violence in childhood, and frequent alcohol consumption. The household dynamics that prevent women from participating in economic decision-making and the widespread acceptance of inequitable gender norms also significantly increase the risk that a woman will experience intimate partner violence. The likelihood that a woman will formally report intimate partner violence is mainly determined by the frequency of the episodes, characteristics of the partners or ex-partners, economic empowerment, and whether she has support networks.;Gender-Based Violence (GBV), Access to and Use of Services;Latin America;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-22;"Saavedra Facusse, Trinidad Berenice; Contreras Urbina, Juan Manuel; Inchauste Comboni, Maria Gabriela";https://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-10016;Economic Empowerment, Gender-Based Violence (GBV), Basic Services;
Closing the Gender Gap in Natural Resource Management Programs in Mexico;This report examines perceived and actual gender differences in the use and management of natural resources and the challenges of integrating women into activities related to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD ) or other natural resource management projects in Mexico. The report applies a behavioral science lens to uncover key psychological, cultural, social, and non-material barriers to womenŐs participation in natural resource projects. Women use natural resources differently than men, which sets the stage for a variety of structural barriers. Differentiated resource use makes women vulnerable to economic, social, and external environmental influences, especially in rural areas. The studyŐs qualitative analysis also reveals activities that rural women in Mexico will prefer to undertake in light of the upcoming forestry programs to be implemented in Mexico by CONAFOR (MexicoŐs National Forest Commission) and the World Bank. The report concludes with a gender action plan (GAP). The GAP provides concrete recommendations for the inclusion of a gender perspective and female empowerment in policies, practices, and projects, especially those related to emission reduction programs, natural resource management, and REDD . When designed to take into consideration gender differences, REDD related activities and natural resource management programs can offer important opportunities for womenŐs empowerment, sustainable resource management, and shared prosperity.;Leadership;Latin America;Report;World Bank Group;Jan-18;Siegmann, Katharina,_Afif, Zeina;http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/927551552882513940/Closing-the-Gender-Gap-in-Natural-Resource-Management-Programs-in-Mexico;Leadership & Management, Climate & Environment, Economic Empowerment, Rural;

Volatility and Inequality as Constraints to Shared Prosperity : Paraguay Equity Assessment;Isolated by nature, and recovering from a period of historically low growth during the eighties and nineties, Paraguay faced many economic and social challenges at the beginning of the twenty first century. By year 2000, Paraguay GDP per capita was only 50 percent of the Latin American average and 34 percent of its MERCOSUR partners. High poverty and inequality were an inherent characteristic of the country. Yet, between 2003 and 2013, Paraguay has performed substantially well, seeing a reduction in moderate and extreme (monetary) poverty. This is essentially the result of a period of average significant growth combined with a reduction in inequality. This report explores the factors associated to the observed improvements in welfare and inequality, and investigates the challenges facing their sustainability, given the historical structural problems of Paraguay to maintain growth and improve social indicators. The underlying question is indeed whether the growth model and reduction in inequality are consistent with a positive social dynamics, taking a comprehensive definition of equity, which includes sustainable elimination of absolute poverty, enhancing equality of opportunity and strengthening agency for all groups.;Other;Latin America;Report;World Bank Group;Jan-15;World Bank;http://hdl.handle.net/10986/18945;Poverty, Other;
Roads to agency : Effects of Enhancing WomenŐs Participation in Rural Roads Projects on WomenŐs Agency;Infrastructure projects, and more specifically, roads construction, and maintenance are one of the core operations of the World Bank. However, despite the increase of gender mainstreaming efforts in transport projects little is known about the effects of these interventions on womenŐs agency defined as the ability to make effective choices and transform these choices into desired outcomesŐ. This study aims to bridge this knowledge gap. The study looks at the effects of womenŐs participation in roads construction and maintenance and rural economy promotion activities on womenŐs agency, which has recently become a focus of study at the World Bank. Through individual interviews and focus groups the study assesses the effects of women-targeted interventions in three rural transport projects in Argentina, Nicaragua, and Peru. By focusing on agency, the study sheds light on effects of gender mainstreaming interventions that have more lasting effects on gender equality given the catalytic value of agency on other gender outcomes such as economic opportunities and endowments. The report is structured as follows: section one gives introduction. Second section describes the gender dimensions and agency-enhancing approaches in transport projects and the gender approaches in project implementation in the selected case studies. The third section provides a summary of the methodology of the study. The fourth section describes the key findings of the qualitative research.

Why Rural Women UseŃor AvoidŃMaternal Health Services : Insights from a Qualitative Study in Bolivia;Bolivia has achieved significant improvements in its reproductive health indicators in recent years. Yet the countryŐs maternal mortality ratio, at 206 per 100,000 women in 2015, was the second highest in the Latin American and Caribbean region after Haiti. BoliviaŐs indigenous women are particularly vulnerable to death from complications related to pregnancy, childbirth, and the post-partum period. In the past, there have been no studies that sought the views of health providers and users to understand and address this problem in rural indigenous communities. This study fills that gap by tapping this experiential knowledge in these communities in Bolivia and gain insights into supply- and demand-side barriers that keep women away from institutional maternal health services. Increasing their use of quality maternal care is vital to long-term goals to lower the countryŐs maternal mortality ratio. Both supply- and demand-side influences restrain the uptake of maternal health services by rural indigenous women. Strengthening the quality of maternal health services, including provider-user interactions, is a first and foremost priority that can be combined with targeted behavior change interventions to reduce community, household, and individual constraints on women seeking maternal health services.;Access to and Use of Services;Latin America;Study;World Bank Group;Jan-20;World Bank;http://hdl.handle.net/10986/34778;Basic Services, Healthcare, Norms, Rural;

Uneven Recovery in Latin America and the Caribbean: Are Women Being Left Behind?;In Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), the effects of the pandemic on labor market outcomes continue to be pronounced, especially for women. Continued pronounced impacts on womenŐs employment are partly driven by a slow recovery of sectors that predominantly employ women. Many new jobs created during the pandemic are informal. Among the new entrants into the labor force, women were more likely than men to land in informality. Policy priorities include gender neutral reforms to the organization of the labor market, plus social safety nets and policies that aim to address gender gaps. The latter include affordable and quality childcare, gender sensitive social assistance, improvements in womenŐs access to finance, and efforts to address persistent norms driving unequal gender roles.;Access to Jobs, Access to and Use of Services, Ownership and Use of Economic Assets;Latin America, Caribbean;Brief;World Bank Group;Jan-22;World Bank;http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099355107072225031/P17583902df7680140be5c0c87e2aab7396;Norms, Discrimination, Access to Capital & Productive Inputs, External Shocks, Employment Access & Opportunities, Informal Economic Activity, Social Protection, Care, Basic Services;
Fostering Skills for Young Women in Argentina;In recent years, Argentina has made significant advances in improving educational opportunities for young women, breaking discriminatory practices, and guaranteeing their sexual and reproductive rights. As a result, the late adolescent fertility rate has considerably declined over the last 5 years, with now 1 teenager giving birth for every 20 women 15 to 19 years old. Yet, teenage pregnancy persists in the social policy agenda as a challenge that can have a pronounced negative impact on the life path of many young women. The World Bank team is discussing future partnerships with government units interested in adopting a skill-building approach for vulnerable female teenagers. While an isolated intervention may have limited effects on adolescent fertility, strengthening aspirations, equitable gender attitudes, and socio-emotional skills can be a critical component for integral educational and health policies with long-lasting impacts for young women.;Human Capital;Latin America;Brief;World Bank Group;Jan-20;World Bank;http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/736721587534719829/Fostering-Skills-for-Young-Women-in-Argentina;Youth, Health, Education;
How Behavioral Science can Nudge Pregnant Women to Attend Prenatal Care in Haiti;Haiti has the highest maternal and neo-natal mortality rates in the Latin America and Caribbean region. Based on current trends, Haiti is unlikely to meet the United Nations' sustainable development goals to reduce the maternal mortality ratio to less than seventy maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030. Low rates of prenatal and postnatal care, and institutional births, are all contributing factors. In an effort to provide actionable ideas to reduce mortality rates, the World Bank, with support from the umbrella facility for gender equality, embarked on a diagnostic to identify structural and behavioral barriers preventing women from attending prenatal care visits, and from delivering at a health institution.

Women's Economic Empowerment in Jordan;"The Government of Jordan has strengthened its commitment in recent years to gender equality and women's social and economic empowerment through Jordan's Renaissance Plan 2019-2020 and more recently through the preparation of the Women's Economic Empowerment Action Plan under the Mashreq Gender Facility. Furthermore, the Jordan National Commission for Women is coordinating the development of the National Women's Strategy, encompassing the government's vision of women's empowerment and the national plans that address different areas of gender equality. The note touches on societal and household level issues such as existing social norms; the enabling environment provided by the legal framework; specific constraints to women's economic activity that are pronounced in the Jordan context such as access to care provisions and transport; access to entrepreneurship and finance, with a focus on technology-enabled services; and what may be considered to attract more Jordanian women in the rural areas to engage in employment in the agriculture sector. Given the saturation of the public sector in terms of employment, the focus is specifically on areas in which the private sector may play a leading role.";Access to Jobs, Access to and Use of Services, Ownership and Use of Economic Assets;Middle East;Technical note;World Bank Group;Jan-20;"Ait Ali Slimane, Meriem; Lundvall, Jonna; Mohindra, Komal; Al Abbadi, Shereen; Kurshitashvili, Nato; Hisou, Ola";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/33587;Private Sector, Agriculture, Rural, Basic Services, Care, Transportation & Mobility, Digital Technologies & Services, Legislation, Norms, Entrepreneurship, Access to Capital & Productive Inputs;
Why aren't more Lebanese women working?;"Ensuring equitable access to jobs and reducing gender gaps is essential for putting MENA countries on the path to inclusive growth and stability. Giving women and girls the opportunity to succeed can transform societies and economies. Reducing gender gaps in employment can help economies diversify their exports; appointing more women onto banking supervision boards can challenge cozy group-think; and tackling gender inequality can reduce income inequality, which, in turn, can drive more sustainable growth. Improving access to jobs for women is also expected to generate positive externalities to the society, by facilitating human capital accumulation, health and nutrition gains for children through increased women-controlled incomes.";Access to Jobs, Human Capital;Middle East;Technical note;World Bank Group;Jan-18;"Elzir, Angela; Sayed, Haneen Ismail";http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/919711526913175663/Why-arent-more-Lebanese-women-working;Employment Access & Opportunities, Health, Education, Private Sector;
The impact of soft skills training on female youth employment: evidence from a randomized experiment in Jordan;Employers around the world complain that youth lack the soft skills needed for success in the workplace. In response, a number of employment programs have begun to incorporate soft skills training, but to date there has been little evidence as to the effectiveness of such programs. This paper reports on a randomized experiment in Jordan in which female community college graduates were randomly assigned to a soft skills training program. Despite this program being twice as long in length as the average program in the region, and taught by a well-regarded provider, we find soft skills training does not have any significant employment impact in three rounds of follow-up surveys. We elicit expectations of academics and development professionals and reveal that these findings are novel and unexpected.;Access to Jobs, Human Capital;Middle East;Article;World Bank Group;Jan-16;Groh, Matthew & Krishnan, Nandini & McKenzie, David & Vishwanath, Tara;https://doi.org/10.1186/s40175-016-0055-9;Employment Access & Opportunities, Education;
How does poverty differ among refugees? Taking a gender lens to the data on Syrian refugees in Jordan;Many reports document the hardships experienced by refugees, highlighting that women and children are a highly vulnerable group. However, empirical analysis of how gender inequality impacts poverty among refugees is limited. We combine registration data for Syrian refugees in Jordan collected by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees with data from its Home Visit surveys to analyze income poverty rates among refugee households. We use an approach that captures the disruption to household structures that results from displacement to evaluate the poverty impacts, comparing refugee households with male and female principal applicants (PAs). We find that distinguishing between different types of principal applicant households is important. Half of the female PAs for nonnuclear households live below the poverty line compared to only one-fifth of male PAs for nonnuclear household. PAs who are widows and widowers also face high poverty risks. Households that have formed because of the unpredictable dynamics of forced displacement, such as unaccompanied children and single caregivers, emerge as extremely vulnerable groups. We show that differences in household composition and individual attributes of male and female PAs are not the only factors driving increased poverty risk. Gender-specific barriers which prevent women accessing labor markets are also a factor. Our findings show that gender inequality amplifies the poverty experienced by a significant number of refugees. Our approach can be used to help policy-makers design more effective programs of assistance and find durable solutions for displaced populations.;Other;Middle East;Article;World Bank Group;Jan-20;"Hanmer, Lucia;ĘRubiano, Eliana;ĘSantamaria, Julieth; Arango, Diana";https://doi.org/10.1080/17938120.2020.1753995;Migration, Poverty, Other;

Trends and Determinants of Female Labor Force Participation in Morocco : An Initial Exploratory Analysis;The U-shape theory argues that at early stages of development, countries experience a reduction in the female labor force participation, eventually followed by a recovery. In Morocco, female labor force participation is now lower than it was two decades ago due to several factors that are discussed in the paper. There is also a persistent 50-percentage-points gender gap in labor force participation rates, despite improvements typically related to development and female inclusionŃsuch as a higher gross domestic product per capita, lower fertility rates, and better access to education. At the same time, urban job creation has not been able to offset rural job destruction nor the increase in the working age population for both genders. Using data from the Moroccan Labor Force Survey, the World Values Survey, and the Arab Barometer, probit models and a multinomial logit are estimated to explore the challenges affecting female insertion into the labor market. The findings show that higher educational attainment increases the probability of female participation, but this relationship has decreased over time, not being enough to offset other obstacles caused by other individual and household characteristics. Being married and the presence of other inactive women are found to decrease female participation. The educational level of the head of household (typically men) increases female inactivity, suggesting that potentially gender roles may drive women out of the labor market and slow the recovery in women's participation.;Access to Jobs, Human Capital;North Africa;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-21;"Lopez-Acevedo, Gladys; Devoto, Florencia; Morales, Mat’as; Roche Rodriguez, Jaime";https://docs.iza.org/dp14218.pdf;Employment Access & Opportunities, Norms, Education;

The Status of Women in Lebanon: Assessing Women's Access to Economic Opportunities, Human Capital Accumulation and Agency;This report provides an up-to-date, holistic reference on the state of women in Lebanon against the broader perspective of general development outcomes while taking into consideration the multiple crises the country is facing. The report presents a data-driven analysis of three key dimensions of gender equality: economic opportunities (including livelihoods), human capital accumulation and agency, and includes a discussion of contextual factors related to institutions and the market underpinning all three dimensions. Specific challenges that refugee women and girls face are also covered and, where data is available and relevant, the report discusses the impacts of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. Based on the thorough assessment, three priority areas for action to address gender gaps and promote womenŐs empowerment are identified: i) policies & programs: supporting policies and programs that boost women's employment and entrepreneurship towards a more equal 'future of work' economy, ii) collaboration: engaging with a diverse set of actors to capitalize on momentum for change towards gender equality, and iii) knowledge: unpacking data to strengthen the impacts of reforms and service delivery benefits to women.;Human Capital, Other;Middle East;Report;World Bank Group;Jan-21;World Bank and UN Women;http://hdl.handle.net/10986/36512;Economic Empowerment, Education, Health, Migration, External Shocks, Entrepreneurship;

Overcoming Barriers to WomenŐs Economic Empowerment in the Philippines;Gender equality is intrinsically linked to sustainable and inclusive growth and development. In recent years, the PhilippinesŐ legal framework has helped move the country toward gender equality. The Philippines has embraced gender equality among its current policy priorities. Increasing female labor force participation is instrumental for accelerating economic growth and fulfilling the PhilippinesŐ aspiration to achieve upper-middle-income status. Despite an extensive literature analyzing the drivers of and obstacles to - womenŐs labor force participation worldwide, and some empirical evidence of correlation for several factors, there is no conclusive consensus on which factors universally matter. This report aims to contribute to a better understanding of gender inequalities in the PhilippinesŐ labor market to help inform strategies to promote womenŐs economic opportunities. The report is not intended to comprehensively address all factors affecting female labor force participation, but instead focuses on a subset of determinants of female labor force participation: education, childcare, and social norms. The selected determinants are those supply-side factors identified as being of particular interest in the country gender action plan (CGAP), as well as in the recent literature, and are not as well understood as other determinants.;Access to Jobs, Human Capital, Access to and Use of Services;Southeast Asia;Report;World Bank Group;Jan-21;"Belghith, Nadia Belhaj Hassine; Lavin, Benjamin Aaron; Lapalombara, Hannah Frohman";http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099830103012227161/P173002056f08e0a909afd0d7c9f381c4d3;Care, Norms, Children, Economic Empowerment, Employment Access & Opportunities, Education;
Women Childcare and Social Norms in the Philippines;Even with significant economic progress and high levels of gender equality, female labor force participation remains persistently low in the Philippines, with less than half of women in the labor market. Childcare and social norms limit Filipinos womenŐs labor force participation. Family responsibilities also influence the types of employment women engage in. The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic disrupted established patterns of work and school, accelerating the adoption of distance learning and remote work where possible. Results from the 2021 women work and childcare survey reveal that womenŐs reluctance to join the labor force seem to be based on beliefs about the role of women in the household as well as the belief that mothers working outside the home can negatively affect children. Addressing gendered social norms with policies is challenging, but the literature points to interventions such as media campaigns, behavior change communication, and attitude change interventions as possible solutions to shifting cultural norms about womenŐs work and to narrowing gender gaps in the labor market. While the changing nature of work with the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the weight of domestic work on women, it also presents new opportunities to raise womenŐs participation in the labor market.;Access to and Use of Services, Access to Jobs;Southeast Asia;Brief;World Bank Group;Jan-21;"Belghith, Nadia Belhaj Hassine; Fernandez, Francine Claire Chang";http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099830003012240232/P1730020c322d10d30a7e500df58cd6f3bd;Care, Norms, Employment Access & Opportunities;
Overcoming Poverty and Inequality in the Philippines: Past, Present, and Prospects for the Future;"In the past three decades, the Philippines has made remarkable progress in reducing poverty. Driven by high growth rates and structural transformation, the poverty rate fell by two-thirds, from 49.2 percent in 1985 to 16.7 percent in 2018. By 2018, the middle class had expanded to nearly 12 million people and the economically secure population had risen to 44 million. This report is intended to inform public debate and policymaking on inequality in the Philippines. It synthesizes core findings from background analyses of the patterns of inequality and poverty and provides policy pointers. The analysis uses a wealth of data from a variety of sources (detailed in Appendix A). In what follows, section two discusses the poverty and inequality impacts of COVID-19. Section three analyzes what has been driving poverty and inequality over the past three decades. Section four discusses the structural causes of current inequality; and section five examines how they affect recovery patterns.

Towards an Inclusive Recovery from COVID-19 Impacts: A Policy Brief;Coronavirus (COVID-19) partly reversed gains made in three decades of sustained decline in poverty and a decade of accelerated reduction in inequality in Philippines. Although the economy is recovering gradually, there are signs that the recovery may be uneven. Income recovery also seems to be slower for the poor. The COVID-19 pandemic may have long-term negative impacts on development of human capital. To manage the pandemic shock, a considerable number of poor households have relied on such adverse coping mechanisms as reducing food consumption, which may aggravate already prevalent child malnutrition and stunting.

Structural Transformation, Job Polarization and Inequality in the Philippines: A Policy Brief;Over the past three decades the Philippines has made great progress in poverty reduction and income growth, but only recently has inequality begun to fall. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, structural transformation had seen a shift of less-educated workers to more productive sectors and occupations, leading to more inclusive growth. Nevertheless, large gaps between education groups persist. The slow expansion of tertiary education has caused a large skill premium. The shock from the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant shift in the workforce toward less productive sectors and occupations. Signs of wage job polarization have emerged in recent years and could heighten as the nature of work changes. The Philippines can leverage the crisis generated by the pandemic to promote necessary reforms to support skills development and promote inclusive recovery.;Human Capital;Southeast Asia;Brief;World Bank Group;Jan-22;"Belghith, Nadia Belhaj Hassine; Fernandez, Francine Claire Chang; Jandoc, Karl Robert Lasmarias";https://documents.worldbank.org/pt/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099702010182235861/idu0e2356edb0ea610434709c7001fb48c9d1eb6;External Shocks, Productivity, Employment Access & Opportunities, Other, Poverty;
Social Norms and Gender Equality: A Descriptive Analysis for South Asia;Despite decades of economic growth, gender inequality in South Asia remains remarkably high. Although not the only one, social norms are a crucial driver of various gender outcomes, including differential economic participation. Using repeated cross-sectional data from nationally representative surveys, this paper explores the long term trends of gender outcomes and social norms (proxied by attitudes towards gender roles) in South Asia. The results corroborate the evidence that there has been almost no progress in gender equality in South Asia over the past half-century. There has been little progress on female labor force participation, marriage age, agency, intimate partner violence, and preference for sons, with education being the only exception. The lack of progress is apparent among all socioeconomic groups, including women who live in urban areas, are educated, and have higher incomes. Gender attitudes also remain unchanged, and in some cases, have become more conservative and have a negative relationship with gender outcomes. Better measurements of social norms and better understanding of how their constraining role can be loosened may be critical for achieving gender equality in the region.;Access to Jobs, Other;South Asia;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-22;"Bussolo, Maurizio; Ezebuihe, Jessy Amarachi; Mu–oz-Boudet, Ana Maria; Poupakis, Stavros; Rahman, Tasmia; Sarma, Nayantara";https://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-10142;Norms, Economic Empowerment, Employment Access & Opportunities;
Can Boosting Savings and Skills Support Female Business Owners in Indonesia? : Evidence From a Randomized Controlled Trial;There is broad evidence of gender gaps in the productivity of microenterprises, which are in part linked to financial and human capital constraints. Existing literature suggests that interventions simultaneously addressing skills and capital constraints can be effective, but there is little evidence to date exploring the combination of skills and savings interventions. This study tests the relative effectiveness and cost effectiveness of providing supply-side incentives to promote agent banking savings accounts, business and financial literacy training for female entrepreneurs, and the combination of the two on womenŐs businesses and agency in Indonesia. The study took place in four hundred and one villages in East Java in which agent banking products were recently introduced. Although the trial found only small positive effects on the take-up of branchless banking services, both interventions had significant positive impacts on womenŐs profits. The impacts of the training and mentoring intervention seem to come in part from improved business practices, greater savings, increased business assets, and increased decision-making power. Because the high incentives treatment impacted womenŐs profits but not any intermediate outcomes the mechanisms are less clear potentially coming either from a more woman-friendly business environment or through using their husbandsŐ savings or their existing savings to support their businesses. Although the high agent incentives are more cost-effective than the training and mentoring, policy makers may still prefer the demand-side intervention, as it has more positive implications for womenŐs overall empowerment and stronger impacts for the poorest quintile of female entrepreneurs.;Ownership and Use of Economic Assets, Human Capital;Southeast Asia;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-20;"Buvinic, Mayra Lourdes;ĘJohnson,HillaryĘC.;ĘPerova,Elizaveta;ĘWitoelar,Firman";http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/837561585728764714/Can-Boosting-Savings-and-Skills-Support-Female-Business-Owners-in-Indonesia-Evidence-From-a-Randomized-Controlled-Trial;Entrepreneurship, Productivity, Education, Access to Capital & Productive Inputs, Financial Services & Inclusion;
Caring for Children and Firms? The Impact of Preschool Expansion on Firm Productivity;Childcare services enable women who were previously unable to work due to taking care of their children to join the labor market. If some women are more productive in market work, rather than unpaid household work, the availability of childcare can potentially improve the allocation of talent across different occupations, triggering an increase in productivity. This paper tests this hypothesis using a survey of manufacturing plants and data on preschool expansion in Indonesia. The analysis relies on a triple difference estimation comparing plants in sectors with different degrees of female labor at baseline. The results suggest that between 2002 and 2014, when a rapid preschool expansion took place in Indonesia, an additional preschool per 1,000 children increased the total factor productivity of manufacturing plants by 11 percent for plants with an average fraction of female workers. The paper provides suggestive evidence that these effects were driven by better labor market matching, enabled by the expansion of female labor supply, and greater job stability for female employees. The results unveil a novel short-term economic impact of childcare services, which complements the long-term growth impact through human capital accumulation.;Access to and Use of Services, Other;Southeast Asia;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-22;"Cali, Massimiliano; Johnson, Hillary C.; Perova, Elizaveta; Ryandiansyah, Nabil Rizky";https://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-10193;Manufacturing, Private Sector, Care, Basic Services, Productivity, Employment Access & Opportunities;
Gender gap in earnings in Vietnam: why do Vietnamese women work in lower paid occupations?;We examine the gender wage gap in Vietnam and show that a non-trivial part of the gap is associated with occupational sorting. We consider three explanations for why occupational sorting emerges. First, we explore whether occupational sorting is driven by gender differences in preferences for non-monetary characteristics of jobs and find that there are indeed differences between the genders in preferences for having a formal contract, insurance, paid leave and shorter hours, which may induce women to forego monetary compensation for these characteristics. Second, we check if occupational sorting among the adult labor force is driven by social norms about gender roles learned and internalized at an early age. To do so we check for evidence of sorting in the aspirations of 12-year-old children by simulating what the gender wage gap would be if boys and girls pursued the occupations they aspire to at 12. And third, for women with higher education, we check if occupational sorting occurs during the school to work transition - if women are less likely to find jobs within their field of study upon graduation. We do not find support for either the second or third hypotheses. Overall, our findings suggest that in Vietnam gender specific preferences for non-monetary job characteristics play a key role in emergence of occupational sorting.;Access to Jobs;Southeast Asia;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-18;"Chowdhury, Iffat Ara; Johnson, Hillary C.; Mannava, Aneesh; Perova, Elizaveta";http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/717051525869722243/Gender-gap-in-earnings-in-Vietnam-why-do-Vietnamese-women-work-in-lower-paid-occupations;Gender Pay Gap, Employment Access & Opportunities, Education, Other;
Conditional Cash Transfers and Gender-Based ViolenceŃDoes the Type of Violence Matter?;The relationship between intimate partner violence and cash transfer programs has been extensively researched, with a consensus that cash transfers are most likely to reduce intimate partner violence. This study uses a regression discontinuity design to examine the effects of a conditional cash transfer program in the Philippines on three types of gender-based violence: (i) intimate partner violence, (ii) domestic violence by non-partners (such as husband's relatives), and (iii) violence outside home. Although the study finds no significant change in intimate partner violence or violence outside of home, it finds a measurable decline in non-partner domestic violence. The study also examines mediating channels through which conditional cash transfers may affect gender-based violence, proposed in earlier literature, namely: (i) stress reduction due to higher income, (ii) increase in womenŐs empowerment, (iii) increase in women's bargaining power, and (iv) strengthened social networks. The findings provide suggestive evidence of changes in all four mitigating channels. This evidence confirms the potential of conditional cash transfer programs to mitigate gender-based violence beyond intimate partner violence, but indicate that depending on the context, additional interventions may be needed to address specific types of gender-based violence.;Gender-Based Violence (GBV);Southeast Asia;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-22;"Dervisevic, Ervin; Perova, Elizaveta; Sahay, Abhilasha";http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099856507072222123/IDU09733c89b0f84e0492609f970a1b1fb55ce51;Gender-Based Violence (GBV), Social Protection;
Long-Term Impacts of Short Exposure to Conditional Cash Transfers in Adolescence: Evidence from the Philippines;This paper evaluates the long-term impacts of the national conditional cash transfer program in the Philippines on beneficiaries who were exposed to it during a relatively short but potentially critical period of transitioning from adolescence to adulthood. The paper estimates the impacts of the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program on men and women who were enrolled in the program for up to 1.5 years when they were between ages 12.5 and 14 and are currently in their early twenties. The analysis finds evidence of impacts on marriage and fertility for women: participation in the program is associated with delay in marriage and the first birth of approximately one year and six months, respectively. No impacts are found on educational or labor market outcomes or proxies for economic welfare.

Measuring Women and MenŐs Work: Main Findings from a Joint ILO and World Bank Study in Sri Lanka;Between 2017 and 2019, the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the World Bank, in collaboration with the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) of Sri Lanka, completed a pilot study in Sri Lanka with the goal of developing guidance on good practice in the measurement of women and menŐs work through household surveys. The study was designed to enable a comparison of the outcomes of two types of household surveys, namely, the labour force survey (LFS) and the multitopic living standards survey (MLSS). This new framework recognizes that people may engaged in multiple working activities within the same period, thereby enabling a complete accounting all work performed. An additional important development was the adoption of an extended set of labour underutilization indicators to supplement the unemployment rate. This report presents a first summary set of the findings of the pilot study. The findings are being used to generate guidance on the measurement of labour across different types of household surveys. While highlighting issues of measurement, the report also emphasizes the valuable data that can be generated if the guidelines and standards are implemented, such as the more comprehensive measurement of all the working contributions of men and women.;Other;South Asia;Study;World Bank Group;Jan-21;"Discenza, Antonio Rinaldo; Gaddis, Isis; Palacios-Lopez, Amparo; Walsh, Kieran";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/36257;Employment Access & Opportunities, Other;
Women Farmers in Timor-Leste: Bridging the Productivity Gap;"While the presence of gender gaps in agricultural productivity is common to many developing countries, understanding the country-specific mechanisms behind them is fundamental for designing policies that can improve the lives of women and men in the agriculture sector. In the present note we estimate the gap in agricultural productivity between female and male farmers in Timor-Leste and examine the factors associated with it. We find that women produce 15 percent less than men per hectare of land and that unequal farm labor and farming tools, lower literacy, limited involvement in cash crop production and farmersŐ groups among women are the most important factors that explain this gap. These findings suggest various avenues of future research and potential policy actions: tailoring agriculture interventions to consider literacy levels of female and male farmers; improving understanding of women and menŐs perceptions of extension services and farming groups, as well as access to tools and labor-saving technology; improving understanding of intra-household decision-making around crop selection and sales alongside analysis of market access, as well as a continued effort to invest in developing capacities in gender-sensitive agriculture dataand analysis.

Preschool Availability and Female Labor Force Participation: Evidence from Indonesia;At 50.9 percent, female labor force participation in Indonesia is far below the regional average of 60.8 percent. Is it being hindered by a lack of affordable childcare services in the country? This paper exploits the joint variations in preschool age eligibility and access to preschool across regions and over years in a difference-in-difference-in-differences framework. With a longitudinal survey that tracks individuals for an average of 22 years, a panel of mothers was constructed to estimate the elasticity of maternal employment to preschool access. The analysis finds that an additional public preschool per 1,000 children increases the work participation of mothers of preschool age eligible children by 11-16 percent from the baseline mean. Private preschools do not increase work participation at the extensive margin, but they increase the likelihood of holding a second job. The availability of preschools induces mothers to informal sector occupations that do not require full-time commitments.;Access to Jobs, Access to and Use of Services;Southeast Asia;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-19;"Halim, Daniel Zefanya; Johnson, Hillary C.; Perova, Elizaveta";http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/393431561484915075/Preschool-Availability-and-Female-Labor-Force-Participation-Evidence-from-Indonesia;Care, Employment Access & Opportunities, Basic Services;
How to Better Capture WomenŐs Agency Through Decision-making Measures: Five Tips from Research in the Philippines;Accurately measuring and understanding agency, or oneŐs ability to make choices and achieve desired outcomes can support the design and targeting of effective development interventions, as well as tracking their impacts. To maximize the effectiveness of development interventions, it is critical to understand womenŐs agency and how agency may influence the effectiveness of program design. WomenŐs decision-making in the household is frequently captured in surveys as a proxy for womenŐs agency. Using new analysis from a spousal survey with farming households in the Philippines, the authors explore which survey questions can accurately capture the difference in agency of women.;Leadership;Southeast Asia;Brief;World Bank Group;Jan-21;"Jarvis,Forest Brach; Johnson,Hillary C.;ĘPerova,Elizaveta";http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/799341619600129275/How-to-Better-Capture-Women-s-Agency-Through-Decision-making-Measures-Five-Tips-from-Research-in-the-Philippines;Leadership & Management, Other;
What do We Know About Interventions to Increase WomenŐs Economic Participation and Empowerment in South Asia?: Self-help Group Programs;The World BankŐs South Asia Region Gender Innovation Lab (SARGIL) is conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of interventions with direct or indirect effects on measures of womenŐs economic empowerment. The review focuses on changes in labor market outcomes, income, and other empowerment indicators. The goal is to document what has and has not worked for women in the region (covering all countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka), understand the types of interventions implemented, and identify gaps in knowledge and action. Interventions are organized into five categories: Skills, Assets, Financial Products, Care, and Empowerment.

Enterprising Women: Toward Equal Business Opportunity in Southeast Asia;This report explores gender differences in entrepreneurship for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME) in Southeast Asia. It analyzes data from five Southeast Asian countries: Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PeopleŐs Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Timor-Leste, and Vietnam, and reviews existing evidence from across the region. Using data from household and firm-level surveys, the report establishes stylized facts about gender gaps in participation in entrepreneurship and in business performance for two types of businesses: microbusinesses and small and medium enterprises (SME). Microbusinesses include businesses with less than 5 employees, and SMEs include businesses with between 5 and 100 employees. This study focuses on MSMEs because they account for 97 percent of all enterprises in Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation countries and because the ownerŐs gender may have a greater influence on the outcomes of MSMEs than large businesses, which are more likely to have multiple owners or be part of a larger corporation. After establishing stylized facts about gender gaps in entrepreneurship, the report employs various econometric. techniques to understand better the factors that are associated with these gaps. Finally, the report makes a case for policy action and presents a review of global evidence on how these factors are best addressed.;Other;Southeast Asia;Report;World Bank Group;Jan-21;"Johnson, Hillary C.; Perova, Elizaveta; Dervisevic, Ervin; Gonzalez Pulgarin, Jhon Jair; Jarvis, Forest Brach; Krylova, Yulia; Liaqat, Sundas; Pancharoen, Akaravuit; Spevack, Alexander Matthew; Trujillo, JosŽ Daniel; Yue Wu";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/37935;Entrepreneurship, Productivity;
Urban Design, Public Spaces, and Social Cohesion: Evidence from a Virtual Reality Experiment;Public spaces can be an instrument to increase social cohesion, yet they are often underutilized. This paper presents findings from a randomized virtual reality experiment with more than 2,000 participants in Karachi, Pakistan. The paper investigates the relationship between urban design, willingness to use public spaces, and social cohesion. The findings show that exposure to a two-and-a-half-minute-long virtual reality experience featuring various urban design and social diversity elements has a statistically significant impact. In particular, improvements in the design of a public park through the virtual reality experience increased the park's perceived attractiveness and participants' willingness to use it. Exposure to diverse social groups in the virtual reality experience, by itself, had mixed impacts on social cohesion indicators such as trust and perception of and willingness to interact with outgroups. The impacts varied by ethnic affiliation, income, sex, and education level. This may be partly explained by the segregated nature of Karachi and the high prevalence of mistrust of outgroups. The paper illustrates how modern technology can be used as an effective, low-cost tool for diagnosing social phenomena, soliciting feedback about urban interventions for inclusive design, and promoting social contact.;Other;South Asia;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-20;"Llopis Abella, Jimena; Fruttero, Anna; Tas, Emcet Oktay; Taj, Umar";https://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-9407;Digital Technologies & Services, Other;
Who Benefits from Better Roads and Why? Mixed Methods Analysis of the Gender-Disaggregated Impacts of a Rural Roads Project in Vietnam;The literature lends empirical support for the idea that improvements to transport infrastructure lead to economic development. How and why the benefits of better transport differ between genders is less clear. This paper attempts to answer this question by combining a nonexperimental impact evaluation of a large-scale rural roads project in Vietnam with qualitative data collection. The paper finds that roads improve economic opportunities for agricultural production and trade: all households increase agricultural trade. Yet only households headed by men capitalize on these opportunities, experiencing an increase in agricultural output and income. Production and income do not increase in households headed by women. The result seems to be driven by a lower level of household labor and access to capital in female-headed households, which constrains their ability to make up-front investments to increase production and income. Overall, the results indicate that female-headed households face constraints in taking advantage of newly created economic opportunities. Coordinating transport investments with complementary development programs addressing these constraints can improve the benefits of better transport for such households.;Access to and Use of Services;Southeast Asia;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-20;"Mannava,Aneesh;ĘPerova,Elizaveta; Tran,PhuongĘThiĘMinh";http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/988911587391789207/Who-Benefits-from-Better-Roads-and-Why-Mixed-Methods-Analysis-of-the-Gender-Disaggregated-Impacts-of-a-Rural-Roads-Project-in-Vietnam;Transportation & Mobility, Productivity, Economic Empowerment, Employment Access & Opportunities;
Analyzing Female Employment Trends in South Asia;"This paper studies employment patterns and trends in South Asia to shed light on determinants of extremely low female employment rates in the region. After a comprehensive literature review, the authors use employment data from about one hundred censuses and surveys from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka to compare employment trends across countries over time. They work through data inconsistencies to standardize definitions of variables to compare demographic and labor market determinants: age, sector, contract type, location, and education. The paper finds that (i) overall since 2001, women's employment participation across South Asian countries has been low and broadly unchanged; (ii) the gender employment gap emerges more clearly in middle age brackets; (iii) rural female employment is higher than urban; (iv) agriculture is the economic sector accounting for the greatest share of female employment, although this is slowly changing in some countries, and; (v) women with mid-level education tend to have lower employment rates than those with both lower and higher education.";Access to Jobs;South Asia;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-20;"Najeeb, Fatima; Morales, Matias; Lopez-Acevedo, Gladys";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/33362;Education, Agriculture, Employment Access & Opportunities;
Public Work Programs and Gender-Based Violence: Evidence from Lao PDR;"Public workfare programs targeted at women have the potential to empower them economically by providing jobs. However, the impact of public workfare programs on gender-based violence is theoretically ambiguous. They may contribute to its reduction through lowering financial stress or improving a womanŐs bargaining position due to independent income. Yet, a womanŐs higher income may also create incentives to use violence for extractive purposes; putting women in a position of provider at home and in male dominated sectors outside the home may create a backlash because these positions violate gender norms. Working outside the home could reduce exposure to an abusive spouse, but it may increase harassment or assault outside the household. This paper analyzes the impacts of a public workfare program in the Lao PeopleŐs Democratic Republic, a lower-middle-income Asian country, where the government randomized implementation of a public workfare program targeted at rural women who received an average payment of US$550 over 18 months. The findings show that the program was successful in increasing female income, but it did not change womenŐs experience of gender-based violence: comparing program participants and control group women, there is no differences in self-reports of intimate partner violence (controlling behavior, emotional violence, or physical violence), violence from other members of the household, or violence from perpetrators outside the household. Some design aspects of this particular program may have resulted in the lack of impacts on gender-based violence. Changes in the design and implementation of public workfare programs are needed for them to work as a mechanism to reduce gender-based violence.";Gender-Based Violence (GBV);Southeast Asia;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-21;"Perova,Elizaveta; Johnson,Erik Caldwell;ĘMannava, Aneesh;ĘReynolds, SarahĘAnne;ĘTeman, AlanaĘHinda";http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/543961623172043096/Public-Work-Programs-and-Gender-Based-Violence-Evidence-from-Lao-PDR;Gender-Based Violence (GBV), Social Protection, Employment Access & Opportunities;
Unfortunate Moms and Unfortunate Children: Impact of the Nepali Civil War on Women's Stature and Intergenerational Health;This paper analyzes the long-term health impacts of Nepal's 1996-2006 civil conflict. It exploits the heterogeneity in conflict intensity across villages and birth cohorts to document long-term health and intergenerational impacts. The analysis finds that childhood exposure to conflict and, in particular, exposure starting in infancy, negatively impacts attained adult height. Each additional month of exposure decreases a women's adult height by 1.36 millimeters. The impacts are not limited to first-generation. The analysis also finds that a mother's exposure to conflict in her childhood is detrimental to her child's health. Mothers exposed to conflict during their childhood have more children and live in less wealthy households, likely reducing their ability to invest during their childrenŐs critical period of physical development. The finding points to a potential trade-off between the quantity and quality of children. The paper uses information on monthly conflict incidents at the village level, which allows identifying identify the effects of exposure to conflict more accurately than prior studies.;Human Capital;South Asia;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-19;Phadera, Lokendra;http://hdl.handle.net/10986/31999;Education, Youth, Other, External Shocks, Poverty, FCV, Health;
The Relationship between Female Labor Force Participation and Violent Conflicts in South Asia;This paper explores the link between the prevalence of violent conflicts and extremely low female labor force participation rates in South Asia. The Labor Force Surveys from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, and Pakistan are merged with the Global Terrorism Database to estimate the relationship between terrorist attacks and female labor supply. Geographical data on exposure to violence are used to compare administrative units exposed to attacks with those not exposed. The analysis finds that one additional attack reduces female labor force participation rates by about 0.008 percentage point, on average. Violence has less impact on male labor participation, thus widening the gender labor participation gap. The paper tests the added -- worker effect theory -- which posits that violence might increase female labor force participation as women try to make up for lost household incomeŃand finds mixed evidence: greater prevalence of attacks may encourage married women to work more hours, but when the environment gets more risky, all women work fewer hours. The paper also finds that violence decreases female labor participation less where it was already higher and has a progressively greater impact on lowering female labor participation where the number of attacks is higher.;Access to Jobs, Other;South Asia;Working paper;World Bank Group;Jan-20;"Robertson, Raymond; Lopez-Acevedo, Gladys; Morales, Matias";http://hdl.handle.net/10986/33517;External Shocks, Employment Access & Opportunities, FCV;
Agricultural Productivity, Diversification, and Gender: Background Report to Sri Lanka Poverty Assessment;"Identifying opportunities to increase agricultural productivity and incomes is an important priority for rural development. Progress toward poverty reduction continued in recent years, but the contribution of the agriculture sector was weak, mainly because productivity improvements were relatively limited. Using detailed individual-level data on agricultural activities, this paper analyzes agricultural production patterns and associated productivity of farm households. Particular attention is paid to (i) diversification toward higher-value, export-oriented crops as a means to increase productivity and earnings; and (ii) gender differences in farming activities and outcomes. The role of structural factors such as access to land is also considered. There are three key findings in this paper. First, diversified farmers, especially those with a crop mix that is focused on export crops or other high-value crops have higher productivity and earnings. The productivity of paddy cultivation is significantly lower than that of other crops, leading to low earnings. Second, production patterns and productivity levels differ distinctively between men and women farmers. Female farmers have higher productivity, as measured by output value per acre, which is mainly explained by their smaller plot size and a crop mix that consists of higher-value crops. However, despite higher productivity, overall farm incomes are lower among female farmers, mainly due to lower access to land. Third, once land size and crop mix are accounted for, unequal access to resources eventually leads to a male productivity advantage, referred to as conditional advantage, after differential access to resources is controlled for via multivariate analysis. Policies to increase the crop mix toward higher-value, export-oriented crops and to equalize access to resources, including land and agricultural inputs, could help improve productivity and income, and reduce gender disparities.";Other, Ownership and Use of Economic Assets;South Asia;Paper;World Bank Group;Jan-21;World Bank;http://hdl.handle.net/10986/36536;Productivity, Agriculture, Access to Capital & Productive Inputs, Discrimination, Poverty;

The Enduring Impacts of a Big Push during Multiple Crises: Experimental Evidence from Afghanistan;How do proven strategies to improve the economic conditions of ultra-poor households hold up against the increasing severity and co-incidence of economic, security, and climate shocks Five years after receiving an economic livelihoods package, and shortly prior to the 2021 regime change, Ňultra-poorÓ women in Afghanistan continued to have significantly higher levels of consumption, assets, market work participation, financial inclusion, childrenŐs school enrollment, and womenŐs psychological well-being and empowerment, relative to the control group. Households boost resilience by diversifying productive activities and the program improves equality by reducing the gaps between ultra-poor and non-ultra- poor households across multiple dimensions.

Influence of COVID-19 on Female Sex Workers in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: A Mixed-Methods Analysis;This study investigates how the landscape of sex work in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, evolved in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic. Using a mixed-methods approach, the analysis triangulates data from quantitative and qualitative sources to quantify shifts in income, demand, and client frequency and describe female sex workersŐ perspectives on their work environment. The COVID-19 restrictions introduced in early 2020 resulted in dramatic decreases in sex work income, leading to extreme financial vulnerability, food insecurity, and challenges in meeting other basic needs such as paying rent. However, in a 2021 follow-up survey, sex workers reported the summer of 2021 as a key turning point, with the demand for sex work rebounding to closer to pre-pandemic levels. Notably, despite the average number of unique weekly clients not yet having fully rebounded, by 2021 the price per client and the total monthly sex work income had returned to pre-pandemic levels. This may potentially be explained by an increased number of repeat clients, which represented a larger proportion of all clients during the COVID-19 pandemic.;Access to Jobs;East Africa;Working paper;World Bank Group;Oct-23;"Balampama, Marianna; De Walque, Damien; Dow, William H.; HŽmono, Rebbeca";https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/40416;External Shocks, Economic Empowerment, Employment Access & Opportunities;

Unraveling the Factors behind Women's Empowerment in the Labor Market in Colombia;This paper examines the evolution of Colombian women's participation in the labor market from 1960 to 2018, shedding light on the complex factors that influence their labor opportunities. The study emphasizes the significance of the historical context in understanding these factors. This research uncovers nuanced insights using a two-step methodology involving principal component analysis and time-varying effect modeling. The results indicate that the transition from high to low fertility rates significantly influenced female labor participation until the late 1970s. Educational advancements, economic growth, and changing marital dynamics also played a role in shaping evolving patterns. From 1980 to 1995, factors such as diminishing fertility, declining infant mortality, and varying economic conditions influenced women's labor involvement. From 1995 to 2010, higher education emerged as a key driver, accompanied by shifting societal norms, and from 2010 to 2018, the period witnessed positive contributions from fertility rates, minimum wage, and male labor participation. This study underscores the intricate relationship between education, demographics, social norms, and economics in shaping women's labor force participation, providing valuable insights for gender-inclusive policies and promoting women's economic empowerment.;Access to Jobs;Latin America;Working paper;World Bank Group;Dec-23;"Iregui-Boh—rquez, Ana Mar’a; Melo-Becerra, Ligia Alba; Ram’rez-Giraldo, Mar’a Teresa; Tribin Uribe, Ana Mar’a; Z‡rate-Solano, HŽctor M.";https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/40795;Economic Empowerment, Education, Norms, Health;
Jordan Economic Monitor, Fall 2023 - Building Success, Breaking Barriers: Unlocking the Economic Power of Women in Jordan;JordanŐs real growth registered 2.4 percent in 2022 and has accelerated to 2.7 percent in H1-2023, compared to a pre-COVID-19 (2012-2019) average of 2.4 percent. Growth was supported by the services sector, agriculture sector, in addition to a robust contribution from agriculture. Inflation decelerated significantly in 2023, supported by favorable base effect, monetary policy tightening and lower global commodity prices. External imbalances have narrowed, supported by a string recovery in tourism activity and travel receipts. Central government fiscal balance was supported by economic growth and revenue-enhancing reforms, whereas total expenditure grew at a slower pace. Despite these positive developments, entrenched structural constraints weigh on labor market outcomes, as labor force participation continues its gradual decline driven by a fall in both male and female participation. Jordanian female labor participation remains among the lowest in the world. Debt-to-GDP ratios continues to rise from already elevated levels with persisting pressures from the electricity and water sectors. The global and regional environments remain challenging. In particular, the conflict in the Middle East has the potential for material economic spillovers on the Jordanian economy, including through its impact on tourism activity. The ŇIn FocusÓ section highlights the role of women and their increased economic participation as central to JordanŐs development agenda. The piece takes a life cycle approach and follows the journey of girls and women from birth through education and into the labor market. It sheds light on two of the main barriers to womenŐs increased participation in the economy: childcare and public transportation. A comprehensive institutional renovation, together with enabling policies and a clear signal regarding the role of women, are all crucial in removing barriers and facilitate the integration of women into the labor force.;Access to Jobs, Access to and Use of Services;Middle East;Report;World Bank Group;Dec-23;World Bank;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/40786;Economic Empowerment, Employment Access & Opportunities, Care, Transportation & Mobility;
Shifting Spousal Decision-Making Patterns: Whom You Target in an Agricultural Intervention Matters;Does it matter whether poverty reduction programs target the female or male spouse? A randomized controllled trial in Ethiopia is used to study the differential impacts of easing information and financial constraints on agricultural productivity and household welfare, using data from 1,214 households in two regions of Ethiopia. The program targeted the husband, the wife, or both in a married household. The results indicate that the targeted spouse determines the type and channel of impacts. Targeting both spouses increased agricultural productivity in the short run and the monetary value of small ruminants and poultry in the long run, with a marginal positive impact on nonfood expenditure. Targeting only the female spouse resulted in increased business income from businesses with female involvement. This consequently increased household use of formal savings devices. This is in line with female preferences outside agriculture and for off-farm activities, and it results in little impact on agricultural productivity, despite an increase in womenŐs access to extension services. Targeting only the male spouse has no impact on household savings or expenditure even though it increases menŐs wage income. The results suggest that the sharing of knowledge about the intervention changed household decisions. This would explain the different outcomes when both spouses were targeted, rather than only one.;Leadership, Ownership and Use of Economic Assets, Other;East Africa;Working paper;World Bank Group;Dec-23;"Bedi, Tara; Buehren, Niklas; Goldstein, Markus; Ketema, Tgist";https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/40787;Poverty, Access to Capital & Productive Inputs, Productivity;
The Effect of COVID-19 on the Gender Employment Gap in Egyptian Manufacturing;This paper examines the evolution of the gender employment gap post COVID-19 in the Egyptian manufacturing sector, using a unique firm-level data set. The findings show that the COVID-19 shock led to a slight improvement in the gender employment gap, both in absolute and relative terms, driven by a larger reduction in male employment compared to that for female employment. The heterogeneity analysis shows that exporting firms and firms in industrial zones on average increased both types of employment post COVID-19. Two types of firms contributed to a worsening of the gender gap, namely firms that adopted technology and those that provided worker training prior to the pandemic, pushing male employment up while not doing the same for female employment. Additionally, the informal sector contributed to a worsening of the gender gap during the pandemic.;Access to Jobs;Middle East;Working paper;World Bank Group;Dec-23;"Ishak, Phoebe W.; El-Haddad, Amirah";https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/40780;Employment Access & Opportunities, Manufacturing, Private Sector, External Shocks;

Gender Disparities and Poverty: A Background Paper for the Togo Poverty and Gender Assessment 2022;Gender gaps in Togo cut across many dimensions. Inequality starts in childhood, when girls are disadvantaged in access to schooling because of prevalent social norms and gender roles. It continues into adolescence, when a larger share of girls starts dropping out of school, unable to continue education because of a number of factors, including child marriage, adolescent pregnancy, and time use patterns shaped by gender norms. In adolescence and adulthood, women face the constraints of limited education and economic opportunities, restrictive gender roles that leave women little time for participation in the labor force, financial inequities, high levels of acceptance of violence against women, health risks, and a lack of agency and decision-making capacity. High prevalence rates of child marriage and adolescent fertility not only increase health risks for women but also reduce the amount of time they have to fully participate in education and in economic opportunities.

Togo: Economic Inclusion of Youth and Women into High Potential Value Chains;Good quality jobs are key to accelerating poverty reduction and strengthening social cohesion in Togo. While Togo has made significant progress in creating more good quality jobs, with robust growth performance in the past decade, several jobs-related challenges remain. TogoŐs labor market is characterized by high levels of informality and underemployment, low productivity, and low-quality jobs. This difficult situation is compounded by the demographic trend of large cohorts of young people entering the labor market every year. As a result of this trend, it is estimated that, beginning in 2024, Togo will need to create 200,000 new jobs every year to absorb the influx of new entrants into the labor market. As described in the companion document to this report, Togo Jobs Diagnostic, a holistic approach to creating more and better jobs should be applied looking at the macro-, demand-, and supply side constraints. Solutions should focus on creating new jobs, improving job quality and productivity, and ensuring access to employment for vulnerable segments of the population.;Access to Jobs;West Africa;Study;World Bank Group;Dec-23;Kroll, Guillaume;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/40755;Employment Access & Opportunities, Informal Economic Activity, Youth, Productivity;
How Have Gender Gaps in the Colombian Labor Market Changed during the Economic Recovery?;This paper analyzes gender gaps in the Colombian labor market, with a particular focus on the impact of the COVID-19 shock and the economic recovery. Using household survey and administrative data, the analysis finds significant and persistent gender gaps in favor of men in terms of participation, unemployment, and income. These gaps are heterogeneous at the regional level in Colombia, and are exacerbated among women with children, particularly young children, and those with low levels of education. The COVID-19 pandemic widened these gaps, including from higher female concentration in the most affected sectors and potentially associated with the disproportionate burden of care on women. Moreover, using decomposition techniques, the paper finds that the decline observed in the hourly gender wage gap results from two offsetting effects: the explained gap, which favors women due to their endowments, primarily education level, and the unexplained gap, which favors men and may be associated with discriminatory biases. Moreover, the gender wage gap widens significantly when considering monthly income, showing variations in hours worked between men and women. Given the poorer labor market outcomes among women with children, policies toward the reduction and redistribution of care work within households could contribute to increase womenŐs opportunities in the labor market.;Access to Jobs;Latin America;Working paper;World Bank Group;Nov-23;"D‡valos, Mar’a E; Londo–o, Diana; Medina, Daniel";https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/40639;Care, Employment Access & Opportunities, External Shocks, Gender Pay Gap;
Herder-Related Violence, Agricultural Work, and the Informal Sector as a Safety Net;Violent conflict between nomadic herders and settledŃmostly agriculturalŃcommunities in Nigeria occurs as both groups clash over the use of land and resources, in part, due to a changing climate. This paper uses panel data from 2010 through 2019 to study the labor responses of individuals to exposure to herder-related violence during the post-planting and post-harvest seasons. Specifically, it considers a Ňshadow of violenceÓ channel, where recent exposure to a violent event alters labor-related responses to a subsequent event. Results find that in the post-planting season, exposure to a herder-related violent event leads to an increase in informal work for both men and women, a decrease in agricultural work for men, and an increase in total hours worked for women among households that have previously been exposed to herder-related violence in the preceding six months. The paper also considers two other specific forms for a Ňshadow of violenceÓ channelŃnamely, raised tensions over open-grazing bans enacted in 2016 and 2017 within three states and a drastic peak in violence in the first half of 2018Ń and find similar results. Lastly, findings show how household exposure to violence can have so-called knock-on effects. Households exposed to herder-related violence in the previous post-planting season shift consumption and crop selling patterns in the post-harvest season. These findings highlight the gender-specific labor response to violence and document the role of the informal sector as a partial safety net for individuals in the presence of adverse shocks.;Other;West Africa;Working paper;World Bank Group;Nov-23;"Bloem, Jeffrey R.; Damon, Amy; Francis, David C; Mitchell, Harrison";https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/40644;Informal Economic Activity, Agriculture, Care, External Shocks, FCV;
Ten-thousand Steps in Her Shoes: The Role of Public Transport in WomenŐs Economic Empowerment Đ Evidence from Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon;"This report sheds light on public transportŐs role in womenŐs access to economic opportunities in urban MENA. It examines the links among mobility, gender, and access to economic opportunities. It provides evidence of gender differences in mobility patterns and travel behavior, as well as the barriers and challenges women face when using public transport. It also assesses whether public transport systemdeficiencies constrain womenŐs economic participation.

A Statistical Portrait of the Indian Female Labor Force;"In India, the female labor force participation rate is higher in rural areas than in urban areas.
The distribution of jobs is highly skewed toward agriculture in the rural economy, which drives down wages for women workers.
Low-earning, unpaid family work and own account work constitute the highest proportion of female employment in rural India, while urban areas have mostly higher-paying regular salaried jobs.
Informal skill training does not lead to an increase in wages for women workers as compared to formal skill training.
Very few women workers in India receive any social security benefits.";Access to Jobs;South Asia;Brief;Asia Development Bank;Dec-23;Fernandez, Cledwyn Puri, Havishaye;https://doi.org/10.56506/BDXR3681;Social Protection, Employment Access & Opportunities, Gender Pay Gap, Care, Agriculture;
Gender Inequality in Latin America and the Caribbean;"This chapter examines gender inequality, focusing on two critical spheres in which gender inequality is generated: education and work. The objective is to provide a current snapshot of gender inequality across key indicators as well as a dynamic perspective that highlights successes and failures. Facilitating a cross-country comparison as well by grouping countries within Latin America by their level of economics development and drawing comparisons with countries outside the region. Finally, it reflect on differences in the ways that gender inequalities play out across different socio-economic groups, particularly those that highlight other sources of inequality.

The second part of the chapter focuses on the worksphere. Here it document significant improvements in female labor force participation over the last 20 years, especially among the least-educated women (those with incomplete secondary education). However, progress has not been equal across all the countries in the region the pace of improvement in this dimension has been slowest in the least economically developed countries. These are also the countries where a significant proportion of the adult working population, especially among men, continue to hold highly conservative norms about women's participation in work.";Human Capital, Access to Jobs;Latin America, Caribbean;Report;Inter-American Development Bank;Dec-23;"Berniell, InŽs;  Fern‡ndez, Raquel;  Krutikova, Sonya";http://dx.doi.org/10.18235/0005328;Education, Employment Access & Opportunities, Poverty;
What Are the Gaps in Health and Education That Women Face throughout Their Lives?;In recent years, significant progress has been made toward implementing policies and programs to support gender equity in Latin America and the Caribbean. However, large disparities continue to exist between men and women in educational and health outcomes. In the region, girls perform better than boys in soft skills and language at an early age and the school attendance gaps favor women at all levels. However, once in school, male students tend to perform better in mathematics in standardized tests compared to their female peers at age 15, with important implications for womens decisions on their future educational and career paths. At the same time, a large proportion of women in the region still lack access to reproductive technology. The maternal mortality rate remains high and tends to correlate with both low income levels and lack of prenatal care. Also, the rate of teen motherhood (1519 years old) is very high.;Human Capital, Access to and Use of Services;Latin America, Caribbean;Brief;Inter-American Development Bank;Dec-23;"Bustelo, Monserrat;  Frisancho, Ver—nica;  Viollaz, Mariana";http://dx.doi.org/10.18235/0005344;Education, Basic Services, Poverty, Health;
What Is the Labor Market Like for Women in Latin America and the Caribbean?;The labor force participation of women in Latin America and the Caribbean is low, and the regions gender gap is one of the widest in the world. Although important progress has been made over the last 50 years (with womens participation rate going from around 20% in the 1960s to more than 60% toward the beginning of the 2010s), the pace of growth slowed down in the early 2000s. Once they enter the labor market, women tend to be employed in lower-paying and lower-quality jobs compared to men. This is due to occupational and educational segregation. On top of this unfavorable situation for women, they are in disadvantage in terms of the 21st century skills (those that are highly valued today and that are expected to continue to have a growing demand) and they face Ňglass ceilingsÓ which limit womens access to hierarchical positions, hindering their professional progression.;Access to Jobs;Latin America, Caribbean;Brief;Inter-American Development Bank;Dec-23;"Frisancho, Ver—nica;  Bustelo, Monserrat;  Viollaz, Mariana";http://dx.doi.org/10.18235/0005341;Discrimination, Employment Access & Opportunities;
COVID-19 Sets Back Progress Made on the Welfare of Women and Diverse Populations;By March 2020, COVID-19 was confirmed present in all Latin American and Caribbean countries. Not only did the pandemic weakened the regions economy, it exacerbated structural inequalities. Women, indigenous peoples, African descendants, persons with disabilities and the LGBTQ community were disproportionately affected by the pandemic, reflecting both the vulnerability of these groups and the fragility of the progress made in recent years toward improving their social welfare.

Household Led by Women: Understanding Access to Housing Credit in Latin America and the Caribbean;The share of Latin American and Caribbean households led by women is rapidly increasing, at the same time as these households are overrepresented among those living in housing deficit. In this study, we looked at whether there is a gender gap in access to housing loans, one of the main tools available to housing. In addition, we explored which are the characteristics of FHHs and to which extent they can have an impact on their access to adequate housing. This study shows how FHHs face greater housing deficits. Our findings indicate that gender gaps in other areas, most importantly in labor markets, are conditioning income and therefore access to financial services. And yet, once results are controlled for observable variables, the gender gap in obtaining a mortgage in LAC shrinks but persists. At all income levels, women had a lower proportion of housing credit ownership than men did at the same income level. That is, a woman would need higher levels of income and education than a man does to achieve the same access to financial services. Likewise, gender gaps are noticeable even when comparing men and women with housing loans. For example, our results indicate that women in the second wealthiest quintile would have the same access to credit as men in the second poorest quintile. Our study also supports the notion that FHHs tend to prioritize housing location over housing, which may explain why FHHs are overcrowded even if not poor.;Ownership and Use of Economic Assets, Access to and Use of Services;Latin America, Caribbean;Study;Inter-American Development Bank;Nov-23;Libertun de Duren, Nora Ruth;http://dx.doi.org/10.18235/0005295;Access to Capital & Productive Inputs, Gender Pay Gap, Financial Services & Inclusion, Discrimination, Other;
Brecha de gŽnero en los ingresos laborales en Ecuador: un an‡lisis de su evoluci—n en el periodo 1995-2021;La brecha de ingresos laborales entre hombres y mujeres en AmŽrica Latina es un obst‡culo para lograr la igualdad de gŽnero y el desarrollo sostenible. En Ecuador, si bien no se observa una brecha pronunciada en ingresos a nivel agregado, se aprecia que persiste una brecha no explicada. A pesar de que las mujeres, en muchos casos, tienen un mejor perfil laboral que los hombres, su nivel de ingresos no refleja ese mejor perfil laboral, lo que sugiere la existencia de sesgos de gŽnero. TambiŽn se aprecia que la brecha total existe entre trabajadores del sector informal, en el ‡rea rural y en trabajadores por cuenta propia. Adem‡s, se percibe una diferencia de ingresos heterogŽnea, pero a favor de los hombres en la mayor’a de las ocupaciones. Para analizar la brecha de ingresos laborales por gŽnero en Ecuador entre 2000 y 2021 se utilizaron las Encuestas Nacional Empleo, Desempleo y Subempleo ENEMDU realizadas por el Instituto Nacional de Estad’stica y Censos de Ecuador (INEC) y armonizadas por el Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo. Se presentan dos metodolog’as para estimarla: la descomposici—n Blinder-Oaxaca y la de „opo. El an‡lisis en el tiempo de m‡s de dos dŽcadas muestra una reducci—n de la brecha de total ingresos laborales en el periodo analizado, y al mismo tiempo parece apuntar a la existencia de discriminaci—n de gŽnero. Esto indica que se requieren esfuerzos adicionales para comprender esta disparidad. El an‡lisis muestra que, si bien la brecha total se ha reducido, como en muchos otros pa’ses de la regi—n, la reducci—n de la brecha total en general est‡ asociada a la brecha explicada, y no a una reducci—n de la brecha no explicada que se mantiene en el tiempo.;Other;Latin America;Technical note;Inter-American Development Bank;Nov-23;"Urquidi, Manuel;  Chalup, Miguel;  Serrate, Liliana";http://dx.doi.org/10.18235/0005249;Gender Pay Gap;

Lawful Progress: Unveiling the Laws That Reshape WomenŐs Work Decisions;This paper examines the impact of womenŐs legal rights on labor force participation decisions made by women and men through a granular analysis of 35 gendered laws. Building on previous literature, it departs from the analysis using aggregate indices due to concerns about (i) the usability of an index for policymaking purposes, (ii) the economic interpretation of an indexŐs average marginal effects, (iii) and the implicit assumption of homogeneous effects underlying regressions with an index. The findings identify nine key laws that can foster female labor force participation. Notably, laws related to household dynamics and womenŐs agency within the family, such as divorce and property rights laws, and laws regarding the ability of women to travel outside the home, are especially important in influencing their decision to work. The paper also shows that improving womenŐs legal rights does not improve their labor force participation through a substitution effect as it has no systematic negative effect on menŐs labor force participation.;Ownership and Use of Economic Assets, Leadership, Access to Jobs;Global;Working paper;IMF;Dec-23;"Anna Fruttero ; Diego B.

Female Headship and Poverty in the Arab Region: Analysis of Trends and Dynamics Based on a New Typology;Various challenges are thought to render female-headed households (FHHs) vulnerable to poverty in the Arab region. Yet, previous studies have mixed results and despite the availability of cross-sectional data, the absence of household panel survey data hinders analysis of poverty dynamics. We address these challenges by proposing a novel typology of FHHs and analyze synthetic panels that we constructed from 20 rounds of repeated cross-sectional surveys spanning the past two decades from Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Mauritania, Palestine, and Tunisia. We find that the definition of FHHs matters for measuring poverty levels and dynamics. Most types of FHHs are less poor, but FHHs with a major share of female adults are generally poorer. FHHs are more likely to escape poverty than households on average, but FHHs without children are most likely to do so. While more children are generally associated with more poverty for FHHs, there is heterogeneity across countries is addition to heterogeneity across FHH measures. Our findings provide useful inputs for social protection and employment programs aiming at reducing gender inequalities and poverty in the Arab region.;Access to Jobs, Other, Leadership;Middle East, North Africa;Discussion paper;IZA;Nov-23;Shireen AlAzzawi, Hai-Anh Dang, Vladimir Hlasny, Kseniya Abanokova, Jere R.

A Gendered Analysis of Poverty among the Employed in South Africa;Poverty is an obstinate issue in South Africa, with many employed individuals still living in poverty. The gender pay gap and employment in low-income jobs are some of the contributing factors to poverty, particularly for women who, on average, earn 30 percent less than men. Women are also more likely to be employed in low-income jobs in the care economy, which offers few benefits, such as domestic work or part-time work. Men, on the other hand, are more likely to be employed in higher-paying jobs in traditionally male-dominated fields. This study seeks to analyse poverty among employed men and women in South Africa using data from the General Household Survey by Statistics South Africa. The results of the regression analysis indicate that women of colour, particularly those with low levels of education and are potentially in precarious employment, are more likely to be poor compared to men. Policies advocating for gender equality in the workforce need to be reinforced while empowering women and men through education and training.;Other, Human Capital;Southern Africa;Article;IDEAS;Nov-23;Jabulile Makhalima;https://ideas.repec.org/a/eco/journ1/2023-06-2.html;Poverty, Education, Gender Pay Gap, Care, Employment Access & Opportunities;
